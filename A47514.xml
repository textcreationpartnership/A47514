            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THO' it was your Ladyſhips Favour to me, that did give the firſt Birth to the Subject contain'd in this Book, by liſting me amongſt your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; which, as it did at once raiſe my Honour, ſo did it the Envy and Malice of my Perſecuters: Yet I could have ſatisfied my ſelf with the humble Content of a lower Patronage, were I not more ambitious of giving ſome Teſtimony of that Service, which I owe You, than deriving Honour upon my ſelf from the Glory of Your Protection.</p>
            <p>But tho' I be not acted by Ambition; yet, when I conſider the Greatneſs of Your Quality, and the Excellency of Your perſonal Accompliſhments on the one hand, and the entertainment ſuch Addreſſes receive from the Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious World on the other, I am apt to think, men will ſay I deſign rather honour to my ſelf, than Service to you. But, Madam, let not the happy Neceſſity I lie under of advantaging my own Credit, while I ſerve You, prejudice the ſincerity of my Intentions, ſince 'tis the conſtant Fate of all the <hi>Votaries</hi> of Greatneſs to be engag'd in ſuch a Neceſſity. And I am the more encourag'd in this, that the Matter I relate is not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Your Ladyſhip; and that I muſt make frequent and honourable Mention of You and your moſt Noble Family; and that I humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, notwithſtanding my Innocence, and the Juſtice of my Cauſe, had I not been ſupported by your Goodneſs and Authority, I might have ſunk under the violence of that Fury and Malice, that did proſecute me. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I wiſh you could find as many things in the Enſuing Papers, which would deſerve your Patronage; as you will, that need it. I hope your Goodneſs will pardon whatever your Judgment cannot approve in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Conduct. I will ever value your ſingle Approbation more, than the Applauſe of the Theatre. But, if I miſs both, I hope you will give me leave to promiſe to my ſelf pardon for the Preſumption of this Addreſs; and to aſſume to my ſelf the honourable Title of,</p>

               </gap> the uſe of many Papers, that contain ſome very material Points, which, no doubt, you will be most deſirous to know. At alſo, becauſe this whole Affair is not yet put to a cloſe, eſpecially the Civil Part.</p>
            <p>And tho' we had all the Papers at Command, ſo that we could give a full relation of every Point, yet it might juſtly be thought a very wild and extravagant thing to ſee a <hi>Piece</hi> of this Nature appear in the World in the form of a great <hi>Volume;</hi> for certainly ſuch would it be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if every thing were ſet down at large; no leſs, as is Computed, if not far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the twenty Books of <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Chronicles.</p>
            <p>Some Papers we have given you at large, leſt the Adverſaries ſhould think themſelves wronged by too ſhort Account, of Matters: Others are ſo contracted, that you have only their <hi>Summ;</hi> as <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> or <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> of which there are about ſeventy, all ſcarcely extending to the length of a ſingle one. And, if any doubt of this brief Account he may have a ſight of the Principal Copies.</p>
            <p>But though we call this Work imperfect, yet know, that this very thing does exceedingly add to its greater Perfection and Ornament; for this being a <hi>Monſtrous-kind of Piece,</hi> its very Deformity becomes its chiefeſt Beauty. As in all monſtrous Creatures the greater be the Multipicity, or Defect of Members; and the more ſtrange kind of miſplacing, or transforming of parts, that makes them appear (if we may ſo ſpeak) the more comely and beautiful in their kind and liker to what truly they are; or, at least, ſhould be. Such will you find this little Piece of Work; but by far the moſt wonderful ſort of Monſter, that ever was to be ſeen in this World. In all other Monſters Heads are always Heads, Tails Tails; but here you'll ſee the Head in a trice turn Tail; Tail Head; Hand Foot, Foot hand. This we promiſe to repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſent to you in a most lively manner by a Judicature, which ſat at <hi>Kelſo, 24 Septemb. 1695,</hi> where the Judges, in the twinkling of an eye, transformed themſelves into Witneſſes; and Witneſſes into Judges: But above all the reſt, there was one Member of that Judicature, who was wonderfully well expert in the Art of <hi>Legerdemain.</hi> This perſon acted his Part to the life, that it was not poſſible for the Spectators to diſcern the Change; he doing it with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Nimbleneſs, that neither their eye, nor their ear was able to follow the motion. He performed four ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees at one inſtant, being a <hi>Party, a Judge, Clerk, and Witneſs;</hi> but the laſt two wonderouſly well: for calling his Name among the reſt of the Witneſses, he anſwered with the ſame breath, <hi>I'm here;</hi> and this he did with a great deal of caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by hitching a little up his back-parts, and continuing the motion of his Tongue, he performed the Jobb.</p>
            <p>But the most astoniſhing thing of all, by far, is the Deſcent one of theſe Judges made to Hell with a Boy in his arms, whom in a violent manner he had dragged out of the boſom of the aged Father, and carried him down to the regions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſhewed him thoſe unquenchable Flames, where with Devils and damned Spirits are to be tortured for ever. This, This buſineſs alone may juſtly ſtrike you with horror and amazement, and make you to quake like an Aſpen-leaf. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating this paſsage Mr. <hi>K.</hi> made the Committee of Bills at <hi>Edenb.</hi> when they were all in a Flame, as if they had been going to devour him, to become as ſtill and calm as Salt. Of which Affair in its place. As to the truth of things here given account of, we hope few or none will queſtion it, except perhaps Parties, or ſuch as are byaſſed with Prejudice, Intereſt, Opinion, or ſome ſuch ſelfiſh Motive. And the more to aſſure you of it, know, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was ſo exact and punctual in this wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If this he had failed to do, it can hardly be imagined, that any Memory on earth could have retained the tenth Part of the Paſsages here recorded with their due Circumſtances. At least his, he confuſſes, could not have done it; and he hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>MR. Kirkwood</hi> having liv'd in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> as <hi>School-maſter</hi> 15 Years, free of any ſtain whatſomever on his Reputation, was immdiately after the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Magiſtrates by Pole in that Burgh (<hi>April</hi> 1689.) threatned by them, being all Biggotly <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> either to forſake the publick place of Worſhip, and go with them to the Meeting-Houſe which was then kept in the Provoſt's-Hall and Kitchin; otherwiſe he might expect to be turn'd out of Doors.</p>
                  <p>He being perſuaded in his Judgment, that the then eſtabliſh'd Government of the Church was Lawful; and convinc'd in Conſcience, that it was his Duty to comply therewith, till the Powers of the Land (<hi>viz.</hi> The Convention of Eſtates then ſitting) ſhould make an alteration in the external Policy of the Church, which in his judgment is indifferent: And tho' there may be a better, and worſe; yet if neither be ſinful, 'tis the duty as he thinks of private Perſons, not only for Peace, but Conſcience ſake to comply: for, tho' in its own Nature it be indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet it ceaſes to be ſo, when ſettled by Law.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon he poſitively refus'd to go with them to their Meeting-Houſe, whatever might be the event; yet he was not wanting to uſe all Lawful and fair means to diſſuade them from forceing him to act contrary to his Conſcience: And therefore he not only promiſed by word, once and again; (for many Commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he had with them) but to aſſure them of his ſincerity, he gave under his hand, in a Letter, written to <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> of <hi>Pardivin,</hi> then Provoſt, that he would chearfully Concur with whatever external Government of the Church the Powers of the Kingdom ſhould be pleaſed to ſettle, judging it his Duty to follow, and not to run before the Laws in matters indifferent.</p>
                  <p>By the way, 'Tis moſt aſtoniſhing to ſee a body of People this day crying out againſt the ſeverity of Rulers, and complaining, that they have not liberty to ſerve God according to their Conſciences; and yet to morrow, when they get the Power in their own hands, they become guilty of that ſame fault which they blam'd ſo <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36252:4"/>
much in others, forgetting that great Principle of Religion, <hi>Do as you would be done to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may return again to our purpoſe; know, that the Magiſtrates did not fail in what they had threatned; for within a very little time, contrary to all Law and Juſtice; contrary to the expreſs Sentence of the Lords of Seſſion, they cauſed their Officers, Four rude Fellows, in a moſt Barbarous manner to drag him out of his own Houſe, and ſhut him up in cloſe Priſon, as if he had been a Malefactor: At that ſame time alſo, they turn'd to the door his Wife and Seven young Children in the cold of Winter; of which buſineſs a particular account was given in a Printed Information and Libel to the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Councel, <hi>Sept.</hi> 1692.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lithgo</hi> were highly Blame-worthy in this matter, is evident from the Sentences of the two moſt Soveraign Courts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the Civil part of this Plea being frequently debated before the Lords of Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and always determin'd in <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s. favour, and the Riots before the Lords of Privy Council, by whom the Magiſtrates, were Fin'd in 4000 Marks <hi>Scots,</hi> for his behalf.</p>

                  <p>AFter a long and Expenſive Plea, <hi>M. K.</hi> in the cold of Winter, came with his Family to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he liv'd above a Year without any Employment, except that it pleaſed the moſt noble and worthy Members of the Committee of Schools and Colleges ſo far to Honour him, as to cauſe him to ſit with them, and give his advice in matters relating to his Profeſſion: where his carriage was ſuch, that it mov'd ſome of them, and other Gentlemen to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſt with him to take their Children under his Care; to which at length he conſented, and within a ſhort while he came to have the greateſt private School, that ever was in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and certainly by far the moſt gainful.</p>
                  <p>When he was, we may ſay, at his heigth this way, having about 140 Scholars, almoſt all Noble Men and Gentlemens Sons, the Counteſs of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> as Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix for the Earl her Son, ſent for him, and gave him the offer of the School of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> with all the Profits and Advantages, that ever was poſſeſt by any in that place. He heartily thanked her Honour for the Offer; but told her he could not embrace it, having to do with ſo many Worthy Gentlemen, who were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſcreet, and bountiful to him; eſpecially conſidering, that he was much in their Debt, they always paying before hand; and a great many of them having only put their Sons to his School a few days before, ſome that very ſame day: And therefore he could not be ſo baſe, as this day to receive Money, and go away to morrow; and he knew very well, that theſe Gentlemen would not receive back their Money. The <hi>Counteſs</hi> preſt, that he might immediatly accept, and go South, in regard the Place had wanted a School-maſter a whole half year; with much difficulty he got 8 days to think upon it, before he gave an Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not far off the Road to ſhew here, that he had at that time very many conſiderable occaſions in his Offer; one in <hi>Virginia</hi> to be Profeſſor of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> in an Univerſity to be erected there in <hi>James-Town;</hi> another to a Free-School in <hi>Ireland</hi> The <hi>Viſcount</hi> of <hi>Star</hi> was very earneſt to have him in the <hi>Weſt</hi> to a place his Lordſhip had Intereſt in. <hi>Mr. William Tulladaf</hi> (of whom hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) Principal in <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was no leſs deſirous to have him Profeſſor of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> there, and ſent a Gentleman from the Patron to him for that end; and to paſs others, none was more preſſing, than the Worthy Lady <hi>Hilton,</hi> who brought with her own hand into his School at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> a Call ſubſcribed by ſeveral Perſons of Honour to be School-maſter at <hi>Duns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that he had conſider'd all Circumſtances, and advis'd with ſome friends (tho moſt were againſt his leaving <hi>Edenburgh</hi>) at laſt he reſolv'd to accept the Call to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Counteſs</hi> being Perſons of great Honour; and (he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)

                  <p>IMmediately the <hi>Countſes</hi> ſent an Expreſs to <hi>Sir William Ker</hi> of <hi>Greenhead,</hi> and others concern'd in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> to acquaint them, that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for this had been their communing the former week at a Meeting about ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a School-Maſter; at which Meeting the Honourable <hi>William Hay</hi> of <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellier</hi> propoſing <hi>M. K.</hi> as a perſon fit for that Charge: All that were preſent did moſt willingly conſent, and humbly begg'd her Ladiſhip would be pleas'd to commune with him upon that head; which, as you have heard, was done.</p>
                  <p>The Town return'd her Ladiſhip moſt hearty thanks for her diligence in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, ſending two of their number (<hi>William Anchram</hi> and <hi>Lancelot Brown</hi>) with an Obligation ſubſcrib'd with their Hands, bearing, that they ſhould Yearly pay 200 Marks Scots, as their proportion of <hi>Mr. K's</hi> Sallery. The Heretors pay other two, and the Kirk Seſſion 50; which with the Caſualties of Baptiſms, Marriages, and Teſtimonials, is all that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> has of Sallary, out of which he is oblig'd to pay his Doctors, as he and they agree: All which particulars are expreſly contain'd in a moſt formal Contract Subſcribed by the <hi>Earl,</hi> and his Lordſhip's Curators, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heretors, and ſuch of the Town, as are in uſe to Subſcribe at the like occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Ground of the Plea between the Kirk-Seſſion, and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> is about the ſaid 50 Marks, and the Caſualties of the Church, to which he lays claim by vertue of his Call; and in proſpect whereof he accepted the Office. The Heretors found their Right on the uninterrupted Conſtitution and Cuſtom of the place, paſt memory of Man; it having always been in their power to preſent a School-Maſter and Seſſion-Clerk in all the Governments of the Church ſince the Reformation; and the ſaid School-Maſter, being always Seſſion-Clerk, ſtill had a Sallary from the Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>This Right and Property of the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and others concern'd in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh cannot be taken from them, but by the Sentence of a Civil Judge: And is it not, think you, very ſtrange, that the Members of a Kirk-Seſſion, being all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould aſſume to themſelves, <hi>Brevi manu,</hi> forſooth, the Power to diſpoſe of the ſaid Office, and the Profits ariſing therefrom.</p>
                  <p>

Only it is not impertinent to ſhew here, that their being a half Years vacancy of the School before <hi>Mr. K's.</hi> Entry, the Members of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Elders in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> having lick'd their fingers with the ſaid Profits, during the ſaid Half-year, were loth to part with them: But of this you will get a more full Account in its proper place, <hi>Part</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Parogr.</hi> 12.</p>

in preſence of the ſaid <hi>Geo.</hi> and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> and <hi>Mr. Colvil,</hi> School-Doctor, did, in Name of the <hi>Earl</hi> and others concern'd, intimate to the ſaid <hi>Wm.</hi> that conform to Ancient Cuſtom, and the Call given to, and the Contract made with <hi>Mr. K.</hi> by the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and others, the ſaid <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was to enter to the ſaid Caſualities and 50 Marks out of the Seſſion-Box; and to officiate as Seſſion-Clerk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, if he pleas'd to ſubſtitute the ſaid <hi>Mr. Colvil</hi> to precent and perform the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices within the Church.

                  <p>Several Weeks paſſed, and yet no return given, tho' both the <hi>Bailyff</hi> and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> frequently preſt to have it: The Presbytery was to be conſulted, and the ſaid <hi>Wm.</hi> protracted as long as he could; for, if he had no advantage from the real Profits, yet he was now and then receiving <hi>Perquiſites,</hi> ſometimes 2 or 3 Scots Pints of Ale, when a Bridegroom came with his Bride to give up their Names. <hi>Michael Fiſher</hi> alſo, another Elder, who officiated as Seſſion-Clerk, was at no loſs by his Employ; for, if he took not Money, as he ſaid one day to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> for Teſtimonials and Abſolvitures, he got not a few Pints of good Ale and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Brandy.</p>
                  <p>By the way know, that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> had agreed with the ſaid <hi>Mr. Colvil</hi> for 100: Marks a Year, that he ſhould officiate as Precentor in his room; and did actually pay it, as his acquittance can make appear; tho' he did never once officiate not <hi>Mr. K.</hi> Receive one farthing of the Caſualities.</p>

                  <p>'TIs moſt pertinent here to give a particular Account of ſome very odd Paſſages, which fell out by an Encounter between <hi>Mr. S.</hi> and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> who had never ſeen one another till that day.</p>
                  <p>The matter is as follows, <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> before he went into the Presbytery, came up to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> walking in the Church-yard with two Gentlmen, and ſaid, <hi>Which of you is</hi> Mr. K.? <hi>What's your will with me?</hi> Anſwered <hi>Mr. K. I would gladly ſpend half an hour with you;</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr. Semple I'll wait on you Sir, when and where you pleaſe:</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>I ſhall call for you after Dinner,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> and thus they parted.</p>
                  <p>Buſineſs, it ſeems, not ſuffering him to call that Night; next day he ſent for <hi>Mr. K.</hi> to the Laird of <hi>Thirleſton</hi>'s Lodging; where he began the following Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſaid he, I have ſent for you, that I may know the ground of that Plea between the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lithgo</hi> and you: I hear much talking of it every where. Did you never, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſee the Printed Information, and the Libel, which I gave unto the Lords of Privy-Council againſt them? Never, reply'd <hi>M. Semple</hi> but I would be glad to ſee them; I was lately, continued he, in the Weſt country, about <hi>Glaſco;</hi> where I ſaw the Provoſt of <hi>Lithgo,</hi> who is now denounc'd Rebel and Fugitive upon your account: Poor Man! He's the only perſon, that has ſuffered in this Government. You muſt excuſe me, <hi>Sir,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Mr: K.</hi> to think, and ſay, otherwiſe, Ten thouſands beſides him have ſuffered hard things, whether juſtly, or not, 'tis not my buſineſs to enquire; but, as to the Provoſt, what he ſuffers, 'tis moſt juſt, unleſs you ſay, that the Lords of Privy Council have committed Iniquity. Would you not be content to be reconcil'd with him? Said <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> I would be a very bad Chriſtian, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Mr. K.</hi> if I refuſed to do that, but, I hope, you'll confeſs, that he ought to ſatisfie me for the injuries he has done me.</p>
                  <p>Come, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> Let us leave this point, ſaid <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> I have another thing to ask you. Tell me, what power Magiſtrates have in the matter of turning out their School-Maſter. Sir, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> I muſt firſt know whether theſe Magiſtrates be the ſole Patrons of the School, or joynt with Heretors, If joynt, the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act without the other.</p>
                  <p>But the chief thing I would know, is the Nature or Tennor of the Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Patrons and their School-Maſter, whether joynt, or not, is one and the ſame thing: If the Contract be expreſs, and poſitive for a certain number of years only, when theſe are expired, no queſtion 'tis in the Patron's option to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him, or not; providing he get a legal warning. But if the contract be <hi>Ad vitam vel culpam,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yet, if the Call be in general terms, <hi>viz.</hi> to be School-Maſter in this or that place; (which, they ſay, is equivelant to the former) the Patrons, whether ſole Heretors, ſole Magiſtrates, or Joynt, have not power to turn out their School-Maſter; unleſs he be guilty of a Fault, and that a relevant one, deſerving Deprivation. And therefore, if that School-Maſter perceive; yea, ſuſpect partiality in his Judges (who in effect are Parties) he may by an Appeal, Advocation, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, carry the matter to a higher Judicature: for who knows not, how often a leading Perſon in Burgh, or Country has for his own ſiniſtrous ends, ſo influenced his fellow Judges, that by their Vote, poor innocent people have been moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly turn'd out of doors, disgrac'd and beggar'd they and theirs for ever.</p>
                  <p>What you ſay, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſeems very rational, reply'd <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> and can hardly be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36252:6"/>
deny'd. I am inform'd, continued he, that a School-Maſter in <hi>Jedburgh</hi> was turn'd out for ſleeping in the Kirk. A very odd reaſon indeed, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> but, pray Sir, tell me, whether that was the ſole Cauſe; or that with other reaſons? I cannot give you a particular account of matters, anſwered <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> I only heard the thing in general: And with theſe words he aroſe, ſaying, It was time for him to go home.</p>

                     <hi>MR. K.</hi> convoying him to the Boat, where he was to croſs <hi>Tweed</hi> (about 200 paces diſtant) ſaid to him on the way; Sir, you have been pleaſed to ask me ſeveral Queſtions; I hope, you'll alſo give me liberty to ſpeak to you about things, wherein I am concern'd. And, firſt, I muſt tell you, Sir, that the Anſwer the Presbytery gave yeſterday to the Petition given in by the <hi>Bailyff</hi> in the name of the <hi>Earl</hi> and others, was very ill taken: and ſome blame you for it. It will haſten the ſettlng of a Miniſter among you, anſwered <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> that your buſineſs be delayed till that be firſt done. Excuſe me, Sir, to differ from you, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> It will rather retard the thing, for your refuſing to ſatisfy a juſt deſire, does irritate perſons concern'd, and makes them averſe to concur with you in other matters. Do you not think, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> anſwered <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> but the Miniſter and Elders are much concern'd to know the Qualifications of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is to be their Clerk and Precentor? No man of common ſenſe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but they are exceeding concern'd in that matter, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> Yea, it is the great concern of the whole Congregation to know that he be every way duly Qualified for his reſpective Offices. And yet, what you ſay makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the buſineſs in hand. It having been, I ſay, in the power of the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and others in the Pariſh of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> paſt Memory (not to mention preſcription) to preſent a School-Maſter and Seſſion-Clerk, theſe two Offices being always lodg'd in one and the ſame Perſon; if he be every way legally Qualified, 'tis not in the option of the Miniſter and Elders to accept, or not accept: And to ſettle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that Office, is to encroach on another man's Right. And, Sir, give me leave to tell you, that the Miniſter and Elders are very incompetent Judges in this Debate, being Parties, and ſo Judges in their own Cauſe; and cannot, but be ſuppoſed to act partially in this affair: For you know, Sir, how Ambitious Men are to have power to place, and diſ-place others at pleaſure; yea, as the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et</hi> ſays, even to kill their Neighbour, tho they do not deſire to do it.</p>

                  <p>But that, which I mainly urge, is, that this Plea under debate is a Civil buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at leaſt as Civil and more than the Right that Patrons had to preſent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Churches, which would have continued to this day, if King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not determined otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>And, Sir, to conclude this Point; Let matters go as they will, by God's aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſhall do nothing that may either give occaſion to alter the Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of this place, or to encroach on the Right of my Worthy Patrons; nor that may tend to the prejuidce of my Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p>By this time they were come to the River, and therefore <hi>Mr. S.</hi> made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; only he ſaid, No man indeed can blame you to ſeek all that is contained in your Contract; and I think they who Contracted with you, are obliged to ſee you get it: Farewell. Fail not to ſend me that Information and Libel about your Plea with the Magiſtrates of <hi>Lithgo:</hi> And thus they parted.</p>

                  <p>At laſt the poor old Man was turned to the door, whether juſtly, or unjuſtly, God knows; and Time, at leaſt Eternity will diſcover.

                  <p>To return to our purpoſe, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> according to his promiſe and <hi>Mr. Semple</hi>'s deſire, ſent him on <hi>Tueſday</hi> thereafter the above mention'd Printed Information and Libel, encloſed in a ſeal'd Letter.</p>
                  <p>In this Letter, after a brief touch of the buſineſs in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> he ſub-joyns in manner of a Poſtſcript ſome things relating to what paſt betwen them in that communing they had, while they were going towards the ſaid River: And at the cloſe, he beggs liberty to tell, that it was neither <hi>Decent,</hi> nor <hi>Orderly,</hi> that Weavers, Taylors, and Livery-Men ſhould be ſet up to Officiate as Precentors; and in the mean time Maſters of Arts, whoſe Right it is to be there, kept down. He adds alſo to this purpoſe; That it gave juſt ground of offence to the people, that two different perſons, the one a weaver brought from <hi>Yettam,</hi> ſix Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the other a Maſter of Arts living in the place; ſhould both at one minute take up two different tunes, the Weaver <hi>Stilt</hi>-tune, the other <hi>London,</hi> making indeed a ſweet Melody, each of them with the help of their own Conſorts, crying and ſqweeking aloud, to drown the voice of their oppoſites.</p>
                  <p>Nor was the Miniſter wanting in his part, for he pretty ſeverely gave the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Arts a <hi>Rapp</hi> on the pate, and ſnatch'd the Book out of his hand.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe in the Church, that were Neuters, did Laugh very heartily; a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber run out of doors, as if fire had been amongſt them. Some <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers (for <hi>Sir John Lanier</hi>'s Regiment was then lying in <hi>Kelſo</hi>) cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>The People are all gone Mad; The Devil's in the Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was remedied the next day, wherein that Miniſter Preach'd, there being no ſinging at all.</p>
                  <p>By the way know, that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was very averſe to give this particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what paſt between <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> and him, but he could not get by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt neceſſary Introduction to a very ſtrange Paſſage, that followed thereon. A Miſtery indeed! A very deep and hidden Myſtery, which neither <hi>M. K.</hi> nor thoſe concern'd in him are able to dive into. A jugling trick it is. A meer Cheat, if ever their was one: but where it lyes, who the <hi>Hocus-pocus,</hi> who <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Part,</hi> there's the Myſtery.</p>

                  <p>The buſineſs is as follows; <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> having received <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Letter, carried it the very next day into the Joynt Presbytery of <hi>Kelſo</hi> and <hi>Jedburgh:</hi> If this was a diſcreet act in him to produce a private Letter in a publick Judicature, without firſt acquainting the Author, let the world judge.</p>
                  <p>This Letter was read again and again, and no little debate and heat about it. What moved <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> to carry it in, what deſign he had in the matter, what words paſt among the Brethren, who were <hi>Pro,</hi> who <hi>Con, Mr. K.</hi> can give no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain account: only he heard in general, that there was a very warm debate on both ſides, and thus it came to his ears.</p>

                     <hi>James Thomſon</hi> and <hi>William Chriſty,</hi> Elders in <hi>Kelſo;</hi> being preſent at that Joynt Presbytery met at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> were removed before reading of the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo knew nothing of the contents thereof. A pretty while after, two or three Elders of other Pariſhes were turn'd out alſo: Theſe had heard and ſeen much of the Conteſt, that was amongſt the Brethren within.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they were come out, <hi>Pray,</hi> ſaid one of them to <hi>Kelſo</hi> Elders, <hi>What ſort of a Man have ye for your School-Maſter? I cannot well tell,</hi> reply'd one of them. <hi>He's a Man ſharp enough; but,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He muſt be a ſtrange kind of man,</hi> ſaid that other; <hi>for he Hectors all the Miniſters at a wonderful rate in a Letter, which he has written to</hi> Mr. Semple <hi>But tell me,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he; <hi>Whom have ye for a Precentor? Sometimes the Miniſter Precents, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another Perſon,</hi> reply'd James Thomſon: <hi>Yond Letter,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>bears, that Weavers, Taylors, and Livery Men Precent in your Church; and ſometimes two ſeveral Perſons in a moſt unſeemly manner take up different Tunes at one inſtant; yea, and that at other times you have no Singing at all: So that the Worſhip of God is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and Imperfect amongſt you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This made <hi>Kelſo</hi> Elders look one to the other, as if their Noſes had been bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They knew the Weaver and Taylor, but could not imagine who was the Livery-Man; tho' they had ſeen him about 10 days before officiating, as Precen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, having Blew Livery; <hi>viz. Mr. S</hi>'s own Servant, his Maſter Preaching at <hi>Kelſo</hi> that day. Follows the Main point, for which all the reſt are adduc'd.</p>

                  <p>AFter a hot and long Conflict about the Contents of <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Letter, at laſt an Act paſſes in his Favour relating to the Petition given in to the Presbytery at <hi>Kelſo</hi> by the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> And <hi>Mr. Gaudy</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Sprouſton</hi> was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acquaint <hi>Sir Wm.

                     <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was aſtoniſh'd at the receipt of <hi>Mr. Gaudy</hi>'s Letter, not knowing the ground, or reaſon of the demur; He thought the world was turn'd <hi>Topſy-Turvy,</hi> that no perſon was thereafter to be believed.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Borleans,</hi> a Member of the ſaid Presbytery, as honeſt and plain-dealing a Man as perhaps is amongſt them, paying <hi>M. K.</hi> his old Acqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If <hi>M. K.</hi> alone were concern'd in this Affair, there would be leſs Ground of Wonder. But to ſee Men in their Circumſtances met together, in a moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, ſitting and acting as Judges, yea, the Meſſengers of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and Ambaſſadors ſent from God; Men, who ought to be Examples to others, of plain and candid Dealing; to ſee, we ſay, theſe Men treat in a moſt jugling and deceitful manner Perſons of the greateſt Honour and Dignity in the Kingdom, is not only an Act of the greateſt Indiſcretion and Rudeneſs imaginable, but the very heighth of Madneſs and Folly.</p>
                  <p>And that which mightily aggravates the thing, is, that they never ſent any of their number to make an Apology to <hi>Sir W.

                  <p>But in effect that would have laid open to the World the Intrigue of the whole buſineſs; and ſo diſcovered the Imperfections (to ſay no worſe) of ſome Reverend Brethren: It was, by far, greater Wiſdom to obſerve the Proverb, which we confeſs is more ſignificant than cleanly. <hi>The more you trample on a Turd, it becomes the broader.</hi> And thus ends that naſty buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>This being premis'd, as a Foundation for what follows; be pleaſed further to know, that after Four or Five Years very hot Conteſt between the Heretors and Elders (Five Men only, every way inſignificant) about placing a Miniſter at

                     <hi>Kelſo,</hi> a frequent Synod meeting there; (<hi>March</hi> 94.) at which Synod as Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders were ſome very worthy Gentlemen, particularly My Lord <hi>Polwart,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Marchmount</hi> and Lord High Chancelor of <hi>Scotland.</hi> His Lordſhip, with ſome other Members of the Synod croſs'd the River to <hi>Bridg-end, Sir W.

After they had talked ſome time in <hi>Sir William</hi>'s Hall, and were not like to come to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: Let us go out, <hi>Sir W.</hi> and take a turn in your Garden, ſaid My Lord: When they were there, his Lordſhip and <hi>Sir W.</hi> drawing a little off from the reſt of the Company, ſpoke to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I could heartily wiſh <hi>Sir W.</hi> ſaid My Lord, that ſome Method were fall'n on, whereby the Differences, that are amongſt you might be taken away: 'Tis a ſad thing, that ſuch a Congregation, as <hi>Kelſo,</hi> ſhould be ſo long without a ſettled Miniſter. 'Tis not the Heretors fault, My Lord, anſwered <hi>Sir. W.</hi> that this place is ſo long vacant; we have offered ſeveral very knowing and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, againſt whom there can be no objection, they being every way qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſome whereof are Members of the ſame Synod: and to go no further; lo, My Lord, there is one, (pointing towards <hi>Mr. Jo. Vetch</hi>) whom I humbly Judge very fit to be Miniſter at <hi>Kelſo.</hi> Truly <hi>Sir W.</hi> replyed My Lord, I think the reſt of the Pariſh ſhould leave the Heretors to nominate, whom they judge fit, provided he be a Perſon qualified according to Law: And as to <hi>Mr. Vetch,</hi> I know him to be a very Judicious Perſon, and a Man of a peaceable and calm Spirit; and therefore moſt fit to be Miniſter at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> to Compoſe the Differences of that place: He is the fitteſt man I know, My Lord, ſaid <hi>Sir W.</hi> but becauſe ſome Heretors are for him; therefore the Elders are againſt him. What method think you then, <hi>Sir W.</hi> ſhall be taken to get you all brought to agree in one man, ſays my Lord? I know none, anſwered <hi>Sir W.</hi> except this; That all who pretend to have any Right in the Call of a Miniſter to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> paſs entirely from it, and put a Blank-Call into the hands of the Synod, leaving it ſolely in their power to fill up what Miniſters name they ſhall Judge fit. And for my part, my Lord, that the World may be convinc'd, that the ſtop lies not at my door, I ſhall go along with the firſt; and, for ought I know, other Heretors will not be averſe to do the like: This cannot be done at this Synod; but againſt the next I ſhall uſe my endeavour to have the Call ready. That is more, replyed my Lord, than in reaſon can be deſired; and I think, the Synod will be ſo juſt, that they will inſert no mans name in the Call, till they know the Heretors are pleaſed with him. And thus they parted in very good terms.</p>
                  <p>A Report of this Communing being made to the Synod by my Lord, they were all exceeding well pleaſed, and thanked his Lordſhip for his diligence in that Affair.</p>

It is ſufficient for our preſent purpoſe to ſhew here, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> was a Member, if not Moderator of the ſaid Committee, and ſtayed behind after the reſt were gone home.</p>
                  <p>What diſcourſe, or communing was between the Presbytery of <hi>Kelſo</hi> and him, as to what paſt in the Synod about ſettling a Miniſter there, we can give you no particular account: This you muſt Collect from what follows.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore know, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> Preached the next Lords-day in the Kirk of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> in order, as afterwards appeared, that the people might know his skill in that Art: Know alſo that the next Lords-day (at leaſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond following.) <hi>Mr. Glen</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Stitchel,</hi> being ſent to Preach at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> told the people from the Pulpit, that he was ordered by the Presbytery to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation to them, that the Heretors, Elders, and others of that Pariſh ſhould meet within the Kirk at <hi>Kelſo</hi> the next Morning, preciſely at Nine a Clock, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſubſcribe a Call to <hi>Mr. W. Jaque,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Biggar.</hi> A wonderful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, you may be ſure to moſt part. Pray <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> might the people juſtly have reply'd; Tell us, by what Right, or Law can <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> be our Miniſter? Were we not told the other day, that <hi>Mr. Guttry</hi> in <hi>Oxnam</hi> was by Act of Synod appointed to be Miniſter of <hi>Kelſo?</hi> Yea, did not ſome of us hear the very Act paſs, and ſee it recorded in your Regiſter? Tell us, pray, what way you have got over the Act? Have you razed it out of the Records of the Synod? This will be found a Heynous Crime. And, if it yet continue there; why is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Null and of no Effect? Shall the Presbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> a very ſmall part of the Provincial Synod of <hi>Merſs</hi> and <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> undo what they have ſo deliberately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by a Law? We cannot think, they will attempt any ſuch thing. And therefore, we muſt beg your pardon, <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> if we doubt of the Truth of what you ſay. Shew us your Commiſſion, otherwiſe we are not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your bare word; eſpecially ſince you cannot back what you ſay by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36252:9"/>
and we can inſtruct our Aſſertion from your own Records: Think not thus to take from us the true Child, and to put in its room a ſpurious Brat. This and much more to this purpoſe might have been objected. And further; It had been moſt proper to have added as follows. Suppoſe, might they have ſaid, we had no right in <hi>Mr. Guttry,</hi> nor he in us by any Act of the Synod: and grant alſo, that the Presbytery had power (as they have not) to nominate a Miniſter for this place, yet they ought to give to all perſons concerned due Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Pray <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> ſpeak ingeniouſly in the matter. Is this Intimation, which you have made from the Pulpit, Legal, or not? Is it conform to the Laws, Cuſtoms and Practice of this Kingdom? Think you it poſſible that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and others, that live at a diſtance, can be advertiſed in ſo ſhort a time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now in the very de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, No, <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> 'tis ſo far from being a due and legal Intimation; that 'tis a perfect Sham: A meer jugling with perſons of Honour. A very Swallow could not give Advertiſement, tho' ſhe had taken flight, as ſoon as the words dropt from your mouth. You know the common Proverb; <hi>Feſtinans canis caecos panit Catulos: Fools haſte is no ſpeed.</hi> You'll perhaps ſee the truth of this hereafter, and repent out of time. 'Tis not in the wit of Man to juſtifie your proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Pray come, <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> let us reaſon the matter in earneſt: Either you deſire the Heretors to meet, or not. If you deſire they meet; how can you require that of them, which you know is not in their power to perform? If you do not deſire they ſhould meet; why make you an Intimation? Is it not in order, that they may meet: So that in effect, you deſire, and not deſire. You deſire in word, and ſeemingly to the World; but in Truth, and in the ſight of God you do not deſire. <hi>Maſs John, Maſs John,</hi> (might they ſay in their own dialect, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Head, and pointing with the Finger, as their cuſtom is) This is not fair dealing. 'Tis Hypocriſy in its hight. a jugling with perſons of Honour: A thing moſt unbecoming one of your Coat, eſpecially, when you ſpeak from the chair of Verity.</p>

                  <p>WE proceed to ſhew you more of this kind of ſtuff, tho' of a different Stamp, yet a true native <hi>Brat</hi> of the former diſcourſe. 'Tis as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>According to the Appointment, the Five Elders with a few, who run their way, failed not to convene preciſely at the hour: Never were men more eager to get hands to a Paper, than both Elders and Miniſters, eſpecially the ſaid <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> preſſing every body to ſubſcribe. Amongſt others came the Bailyff, and unhappily put to his hand; for which the honeſt Gentleman was turned out of his Office by the Earl and his Curators. The Miniſters had perſuaded the Bailyff that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> was an excellent perſon; but within a few days thereafter get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Deſcription of his humour and temper of Spirit, he ſore repented of what he had done.</p>
                  <p>The Elders no doubt by the advice of the Brethren, not thinking themſelves ſufficiently ſecure with the Subſcriptions got within the Kirk, went thro' the town for more: Nor did they reſt within Burgh, but travelled to the Country to ſee what purchaſe they could make there. And that we may put an end to this point, we ſhall only give you the following Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>It fell to the lot of <hi>Jo.

After ſome little courſe Complement, ſuch as; <hi>What now,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin; <hi>you are alway buſie, is it not time to reſt your ſelf,</hi> quoth <hi>John?

O O O, but he's a brave man! Every body is Subſcribing his Call.

                  <p>'Tis worth the while here to ſhew you, that <hi>John</hi> asked not for Good-man <hi>Dandy, Robins</hi> Maſter; for he had refuſed already to ſubſcribe, when deſired by <hi>Michael Fiſher</hi> another Elder. <hi>Come,</hi> Dandy, ſaid <hi>Michael; lend us a touch of your fore-foot to a Paper here.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw,</hi> as we ſay.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this; know, that a debate falling out between <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> or rather between the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> about a Brew-Houſe or Cellar; for which <hi>Mr. K.</hi> being ſummoned at <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Inſtance to compiere before the Sheriff of <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> his Proctour crav'd to ſee <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Call in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to know his Right to purſue for the ſaid Cellar: Whereupon <hi>Mr. Archibald Dowglaſs,</hi> Sheriff Depute, paſt an <hi>Interloquitor,</hi> that it ſhould be produced next Court day; which being come, the Defenders Proctour, crav'd the Call might be produc'd. There is no need, ſays the oppoſite Proctour, to produce any ſuch paper, it being manifeſt to all, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> is Miniſter at <hi>Kelſo:</hi> The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppon'd the other days <hi>Interloquitor.</hi>

To which it was reply'd by the Defenders Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour; That as all Writs, whereupon Proceſſes are founded, are given up to ſee, and object againſt; ſo much more ought this Call, ſeeing from their Shyneſs in ſuffering it to be ſeen, 'twas preſumable that 'tis forg'd; adding, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to Inſtruct, beſides ſeveral other groſs Informalities, which might be made appear, if the Call were given up, that many perſons had Subſcribed the ſame, who had no Right to do it; yea ſaid he further, I offer to prove, that there are hands at that Call, of perſons that could never write in their Life. Theſe, and many other things to this purpoſe, were openly ſpoken in the Face of the Sheriff-Court at <hi>Jedburgh.</hi> As to the buſineſs of the ſaid Cellar, or Vault, which gave occaſion to this Debate, you will have a particular account thereof, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>Anſ.</hi> to the 15. <hi>Art.

                  <p>THe Call being ſign'd, as you have heard, was carried to <hi>Biggar;</hi> where, you may be ſure, it was made very welcome by <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> who was weary of that People; or rather they weary of him, and that not only

theſe of the meaner ſort; but perſons of the higheſt dignity in this Nation: And which is yet more Remarkable, ſuch as very much favour his Party; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Noble Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> of which thing you may likely have a touch in the laſt or fifth part of this Proceſs.</p>
                  <p>We cannot well paſs here an expreſſion, they ſay, he had to ſome perſons at <hi>Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> when they were adviſing of him not to go to <hi>Kelſo.

I hope, he who vanquiſh'd the Twenty Seven Gods of</hi> Lithgo, <hi>will not be eaſily run down by one ſingle Man.</hi> At this <hi>Mr. Jaques</hi> Nephew ſtood, as if his Noſe had been bleeding. Many hundreds of Inſtances could be adduc'd to confirm what's here alleg'd, were it not a little off the purpoſe; we ſhall therefore conclude with this ſmall one, when <hi>Kelſo</hi> Carriers were bringing away his Houſhold Furniture from <hi>Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> ſome of the people there ſaid to them; <hi>Take him to you, take him to you with God's bleſſing, for much Sap and Sorrow we have had ſince he came amongſt us.</hi> In a word, he has liv'd all his Life in Contention with his Neighbours; hence they compare him to the <hi>Salamander,</hi> a Creature that can live in Fire without being burnt: He lov'd Debates, when he was a Proctour in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now forbear, tho' an Ambaſſador of everlaſting Peace.

                  <p>THe Call carried to <hi>Biggar,</hi> as above related; after a very ſhort Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in that Country (the particulars whereof we cannot well give you, nor is it very needful, that you know them) return'd back by <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where it was confirm'd and ratified by the Gommiſſion of the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in all its ſteps. <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s very far from thinking that the Commiſſion is guilty of Iniquity, or Injuſtice in this matter; yet he muſt be pardon'd, if he ſay, they are not altogether free of a fault. He ſees they are but men, and ſo apt to fall into miſtakes. 'Tis indeed but a ſmall one; hardly worth the naming. If there be, as ſome ſay, <hi>Venial</hi> Sins, this is one. 'Tis Incident to the beſt of Men, and the better they be, they are the more ready to fall into it. In a word, 'tis <hi>Credulity.</hi> This is their fault. They believed all they ſaw, and heard. It has been with them, as it was with that excellent Man, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſight of old clouted Shooes, torn and rent Garments, and pieces of mouldy Bread, and the lying Rhetorick of the crafty <hi>Gibeonites</hi> made the Princes of the Congregation believe all they ſpoke, as certain Truths. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 'Tis juſt ſo in the preſent Caſe. The Commiſſion ſeeing an Infinite number of Subſcriptions, what hundreds of Perſons Atteſting the truth of things, two compleat ſheets, and leſs than the half of the one containing the Call; the reſt pack'd with Names of Men, or rather Vermin for moſt part, could not but give Credit; eſpecially conſidering, how matters were held forth with all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36252:11"/>
Art of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> imaginable; the Members of the Presbytery and Kirk-Seſſion, that went along with the Call, repreſenting, or rather miſ-repreſenting things to the Commiſſion with all the force of Eloquence, or rather <hi>Gibeonitiſh</hi> Deceit and Cunning they were Maſters of. This in general we dare with confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; tho' their very words in particular we cannot condeſcend upon; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were to this purpoſe. <hi>Never; yea, never had any man a more univerſal and unanimous Call from a Pariſh, than</hi> Mr. Jaque <hi>has from Heretors, Elders and others in</hi> Kelſo: <hi>Every one Preſt to Subſcribe. They are even going mad, as it were, to have him, ſince they heard him Preach; ſo mighty well pleaſed they were with him,</hi> &amp;c. Think not that theſe are fancys and dreams; no, they are certain Truths. The whole tract of things above related crys aloud the reallity thereof. Examine matters, take them not on truſt; make enquiry into the Call with all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Conſider well that abovementioned Expreſſion <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Proctour had in the Face of the Sheriff-Court. <hi>'Tis not fit, My Lord Sheriff,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that every body ſee this Call.</hi> This very Expreſſion is a demonſtration of its Naughtineſs, we ſhall yet farther add one other Argument, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all the world of the truth of what's here related; and 'tis this. A Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Presbytery Preaching that day <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> was Inſtall'd, while he was exhorting the people (Men and Women) to hold up their right Hands as a ſign of their hearty conſent to accept <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> for their Miniſter, the more to puſh them forward to that duty, uſed this Argument: <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>has a moſt unanimous Call from all Perſons, Heretors, Elders and others,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas not ſo much as one Heretor has Subſcribed the Call, or given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>A Fortiore,</hi> If that Member of the Presbytery had the Confidence in the Pulpit of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> before ſome hundreds of perſons, who knew the contrary, to aſſert ſuch Doctrine, judge you with what freedom he would ſpeak that, and the like elſewhere, to people that were ignorant of matters. There were ſome that run out of the Church when they heard it, ſaying to themſelves, <hi>Good God! Whom ſhall we believe, when the Ambaſſadors of Jeſus ſpeak ſuch groſs Falſhoods in the face of the Sun?</hi> And in truth <hi>Mr. K.</hi> when he heard it, did caſt his Cloak over his Face, being aſham'd to behold the Light; ſo far was he from holding up his hand. Now, do you really believe, that if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion had known the true ſtate of all things relating to this Call; how Illegally matters were carried on in all its ſteps, as is above made manifeſt; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly how the Heretors and others were abuſed and cheated by the <hi>Sham</hi> and Mock-Intimation made to them by <hi>Mr. Glen;</hi> Is it poſſible, we ſay, you can really think, that the Commiſſion would have confirmed and ratified ſuch an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and Illegal Call? No, no, certainly. No more than good <hi>Joſhuah</hi> would have made Peace with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> if he had known where they lived. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, Credulity,</hi> the leaſt of Sins, but too too often the Mother of much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>

                  <p>AS it was very proper to give ſome account of the way of <hi>Mr. J</hi>'s Entry to the Kirk at <hi>Kelſo;</hi> ſo now, we hope, none will think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to give here a touch of his Carriage after he was ſetled there. Every body would have thought (eſpecially conſidering the odd way of his Entry to the place, and the quality and Circumſtances of theſe he had to do with) that he would have taken ſome prudent and diſcreet method to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to gain the hearts of thoſe he was to have the overſight of; not only, that he might live the more contentedly among them; but chiefly, that he might be in a better capacity to do good to their Souls: But on the contrary, his way
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36252:11"/>
is to Hector and Domineer over People, and to abuſe and calumniate them in a moſt unchriſtian manner.</p>
                  <p>As to what he has done to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> 'tis needleſs here to mention: That you'll ſee again and again almoſt in every line of the following ſheets. If his carriage were only rude and unchriſtian to him, people, that are not acquainted with matters might juſtly believe that all the Diſorder, Confuſion and Contention in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> has its riſe rather from <hi>Mr. K.</hi> School-Maſter, than <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel. But 'tis good (good, we ſay, in ſome ſenſe) that there are Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds beſides <hi>Mr. K.</hi> with whom he has odd <hi>ſtickling:</hi> Of which, there are not a few of his own gang. It were endleſs to go through particulars: If any doubt, a very little enquiry will find out the truth. At his Entry many of the beſt Note in the Pariſh, who now abſent, did keep the Church; but when they found him run wild, both as to Doctrine and Practiſe, they deſerted: particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Sir W. Ker,</hi> Bailyff <hi>Pringle,</hi> &amp;c. Pray, is't any wonder people be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when openly in the Pulpit he calls theſe, that do not run with him to the ſame exceſs of opinion, <hi>Devils a communion of Devils, a company of Prophane Men and Women,</hi> &amp;c. And while he ſits in Judgment with his Elders, he calls people <hi>Lyars, notorious Lyars, Knaves, Companions of that Helliſh Crew, that go to the Meeting-Houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is he a whit better in Civil matters. Has he not uſurp'd the right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and other Heretors, by giving a Call to a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and ſetling him in the place: to ſay nothing of the other Offices? Has he not with his five Elders without any Viſitation, or calling for perſons concern'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved ſeveral ſeats in the Church? A complaint thereof being made to the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyff, they were order'd to carry them back to their own place. Yea he has done ſtranger things than this. He borrow'd from a Gentlewoman a Desk or Seat for the uſe of his Wife, which, without the owners knowledge, he turn'd into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form; a thing as ridiculous and unjuſt, as if you ſhould borrow your Neighbours Cloak, and turn it into a Coat for your own Conveniency. The reaſon of this alteration of the Seat was; becauſe <hi>Mrs. Jaque</hi> is ſo mighty groſs, that, as the Seat was formerly, ſhe could not have ſufficient room in it. The Gentlewoman hearing what was done to her Seat, ſent for one of the Elders; and challeng'd him for what was done to her. He anſwer'd, that the Elders could not help things: <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> did what he pleaſed in Seſſion. Many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of very ſtrange paſſages might be adduc'd, if we were not haſtening to conclude this point. Take therefore only this one other; by which you ſhall know, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> not only does great Injuries to Strangers or Laicks, but alſo to his own Brethren, whom he ſtands not to abuſe at a ſtrange rate, and that in the face of the moſt publick Judicatures of the Church. No man is more againſt Lords in the Church, than <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> and yet he can Lord over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and <hi>Banter</hi> them at pleaſure. In the face of the Synod (<hi>Oct.</hi> 96.) when a very Worthy, and Reverend Brother <hi>Mr. Orock,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Hawick</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onering his Conſcience in defence of the Truth in a point relating to <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Proceſs, he moſt uncharitably called him <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Agent. And know that in a Paper (of which in its place <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. <hi>Part.</hi> 4.) given into the ſaid Synod, and which at that minute was the Subject of their debate, being publickly read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, he calls <hi>Mr. K. The Devils Agent,</hi> and <hi>Factor for Hell.</hi> So that by an infallible conſequence, honeſt <hi>Mr. Orock</hi> is but the <hi>Devil's Agent's Deputy,</hi> and <hi>an Inferiour Factor for Hell:</hi> If that be true, which <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> ſays and writes.</p>
                  <p>From ſuch a Man good Lord deliver us. To whom in the world can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him? He is infinitely worſe, than the Uſurper <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who, tho' he raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>SO much for matters of Fact. As to thoſe things, which are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, either by the Canons, Cuſtom, and Practice of the Church; or the Publick Laws of the Kingdom, we ſhall leave them to the Enquiry and judgment of thoſe, that are better vers'd and more experienced in ſuch Studies: Yet we humbly judge it not altogether improper for us to propoſe here ſome few <hi>Queries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1. If a Provincial Synod has after great deliberation paſt an Act appointing ſuch a Man to be Miniſter in ſuch a place; whether or not, may a Presbytery of that Synod, eight or ten days thereafter go about to ſetle another in his room? And what Cenſure deſerve they, if they do ſo? Now know, that neither the Presbytery, nor they with others had any Power, or Commiſſion given them by the Synod to do ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. If the ſaid Presbytery going on to ſetle another Miniſter, than was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Synod, make a <hi>Sham</hi> and Mock intimation (ſuch as is above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) what Cenſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. If the Miniſters, or Elders, or both, uſe ſiniſtrous methods (ſuch as are above related) to get Subſcriptions; eſpecially from Perſons that have not right to ſubſcribe a Call, What, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 4. If theſe Miniſters, or Elders, miſ-repreſent things to a Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to a Congregation, in order to carry on and effectuate their buſineſs; What, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 5. If <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> not only knew, that another had right by Act of Synod to be Miniſter at <hi>Kelſo;</hi> but did actually commune and diſcourſe with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery about his own ſetlement there: yea, went up to the Pulpit on deſign to give the People <hi>a Specimen</hi> of his Abilities. Now, whether, or not, may it be ſaid, he was in ſome reſpect <hi>Active,</hi> and not <hi>altogether Paſſive</hi> in the matter? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to commune and diſcourſe with others upon the Subject; and to ſtep up to the Pulpit, and Preach for ſuch an end, doth clearly import more than to be purely, on altogether paſſive in the affair; all theſe words in their native and proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification implying action. Hence you may infallibly infer, that it <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> wrote to a Gentleman, that he was <hi>Altogether paſſive</hi> in this preſent affair, he wrote that which he knew was falſe; What Cenſure therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 6. If <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> did publiſh abroad in his Letters, and otherwiſe (as can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be inſtructed by the production of ſome of them) that the ſaid Bailyff <hi>Pringle</hi> and others, did ſubſcribe his Call by the Conſent and Direction of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Heretors; and if this be not true, What, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, certainly the principal Heretors are the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh, Sir W. Ker</hi> of <hi>Greenhead,</hi> and <hi>Cavers Ker;</hi> to name no more. That the <hi>Bailyff</hi> and others did not ſubſcribe <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Call by their direction, does moſt evidently appear from this; <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Perſons of Honour did expreſly declare in a Petition ſubſcribed with their hands, and given into the General-Aſſembly (<hi>Jan.</hi> 96.) that they did not own <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Call, and that it was Null, <hi>ab Initio,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 7. If it be ſtanding in the Records of the Presbytery Book, (as one of <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Letters bears) that the Bailyff and others ſubſcribed the Call by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Principal Heretors; and this be falſe, as is above related; What Cenſure does the Presbytery deſerve?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 8. If <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Call to be Miniſter at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> ſhall be found to be Illegal;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36252:12"/>
and his carriage ſince his Entry juſtly offenſive and diſpleaſing to the far moſt conſiderable part of the Pariſh; and little or no hopes that things ſhall grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Whether, or not ought he to be removed from the place? Many other moſt pertinent Queſtions might be here moved; ſuch as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How came this buſineſs in before the Commiſſion, ſince there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made to them, neither by the General-Aſſembly, nor Synod in the ſaid matter? 2. Why has not the Synod cenſur'd the Presbytery for ſo palpable and groſs an Enormity? 3. When the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and others gave in a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the General-Aſſembly, complaining of the great Injury done them in the ſaid matter; pray, why was their Petition rejected? Ah, did you not hear this, and the other Brother cry out, <hi>Moderator, Moderator; That Petition is not to be regarded; becauſe it comes to us,</hi> per Saltum. <hi>They ought firſt to make Addreſſes to the Presbytery; next to the Synod: and if juſtice be not done them by theſe Judicatures; then are they to complain to us. The Presbytery!</hi> A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge indeed! Is it fit, think you, that he who gave the wound, ſhould determine the Injured Perſons ſatisfaction, or his own puniſhment? As to the Synod; if we may ſay it, that Judicature is not much fitter than the other to judge in this affair; For many, if not moſt of the Miniſters, eſpecially the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, cannot free themſelves of being <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Part</hi> (as we ſay) in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under debate; otherwiſe it can hardly be well believed, that they would bear ſo patiently the Affront and Injury, that is done to themſelves in this buſineſs. And if you ſhould doubt of the truth of what we here aſſert, we can point ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the leading Miniſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs, that were very active to effectuate the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preſent conſideration. As to the worthy Gentlemen, the Ruling Elders, we can ſay little or nothing againſt them; except that they too ſeldom keep Diet, which is no ſmall loſs to thoſe that have buſineſs before theſe Judicatures. And for the Inferiour ſort, 'tis too too well known that they follow the crowd, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but running in the ſame line with their leader: What <hi>Maſs John</hi> ſays, they will not ſtand much to ſwear. Now we leave to the Conſideration of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſon, whether or not the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> and others concern'd in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> had juſt ground to decline the ſaid two Judicatures in this preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; and to make their Addreſſes to the <hi>General-Aſſembly.</hi> No reply can be made here; except you ſay, <hi>The buſineſs ought firſt to be tabled at leaſt, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated before theſe Courts; and when you found your ſelf leſſn'd there; then you might carry it to the General-Aſſembly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We Anſwer, 1. To carry it into the Presbytery, is an act of great folly and madneſs; for they are all Parties, the very perſons that have done the Injury. And, as is above made manifeſt, the Synod is little better, a great many of them eſpecially theſe of greateſt power and influence, being alſo parties, and ſo moſt incompetent Judges. 2. Make of this thing what you pleaſe: 'tis but a little failing in form; there is no real injuſtice; no injury, or evil done to any perſon,</p>
                  <p>It may ſeem very ſtrange to ſee Church Judicatures break over all form; yea, and ſubſtance too, not regarding material juſtice it ſelf (as is evident in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſs) in matters of their own concern; but if other people fail in the leaſt <hi>Punctilio;</hi> were it but in Form, or ſome Circumſtance; then they cry out, <hi>That's intolerable, we cannot win over it,</hi> &amp;c. May it not be ſaid of too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as our Saviour ſaid of the <hi>Phariſees (S. Mat.</hi> 23.4.) <hi>They bind hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens ſhoulders; but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will not move them with one of their fingers.</hi> So much for <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Call.</p>
                  <p>Now begins hot work; yea fierce and bloody War, as you ſhall ſee before we come to an End,</p>

                  <p>WE ſhall in the firſt place ſuppoſe <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> had a legal Call; for in Truth, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> did not then know that it was, what it is: The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next day after <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> was Inſtall'd, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> went to him, and gave him. a particular account of his Circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> How it had been the conſtant practice and cuſtom of the place, paſt memory of Man, that whoſoever was School-Maſter, was alſo Seſſion-Clerk, Precentor and Reader, and had 50 Marks out of the Seſſion-Box, beſides the Caſualities ariſing from the ſaid Offices: To all which, he by his Call and Contract had right. In ſhort, after ſome reaſoning about the matter, <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> ſaid, he wou'd take the advice of his Brethren in the Affair: And thus they parted.</p>
                  <p>About 2 or 3 weeks thereafter, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> went again to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> to know his mind in the ſaid buſineſs. The Presbytries Advice, ſaid <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> is, that you make your application to the Kirk-Seſſion. And thus they parted without ſpeaking one other word. Accordingly (not without the advice of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, Heretors and others) the following Petition was delivered out of <hi>Mr. K</hi>s hand to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> in preſence of Two or Three Elders and ſome other perſons in <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s own Houſe, 11th. <hi>March,</hi> 95.</p>

                  <p>THe reſult of their Conſultation was, as follows. The next morning about Eight a Clock they got to the Church, and there kept Seſſion. They had not ſit long, when they order their Officer to call <hi>Mr. K.</hi> without any previous citation or warning. When he came before them; <hi>We have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> ſays <hi>Mr. Jaque your Petition; we deſire to ſee your Teſtimonials and Contract. M. K.</hi> laid down on the Seſſion-Table Teſtimonials, boaring his Chriſtian beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from his very Infancy to the day he came to <hi>Kelſo</hi> Two very ample Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials from the Presbytery of <hi>Hadinton,</hi> where he paſt his Tryals in order to Preaching; one from <hi>Mr. Seton</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Lithgo,</hi> two from <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> the one from <hi>Doctor Rule,</hi> Principal of the College there, and Miniſter in the <hi>Grey-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi>-Church; the other from <hi>Monſieur Depon,</hi> Miniſter of the <hi>French</hi> Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe this buſineſs about Teſtimonials comes in hereafter again and again, we ſhall leave it to its more proper place: Only ſuffer us here to make a ſhort, but no very impertinent digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that <hi>Mrs. Kirkwood</hi> (whoſe name is <hi>Gelecina Van-Beeſt</hi>) is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, deſcended of honeſt Parents; her Mother a <hi>French</hi>-woman; her Father a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who, bleſſed be God, is yet alive (1698) and has been keeper of the Magazine of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> about 56. years: Her Brother Captain <hi>Joſhuah Van-Beeſt</hi> is well known to thouſands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and has ſuffer'd not a little for the preſent Government; was ſore Wounded and taken Priſoner at <hi>Gillycrancky,</hi> and lay long in the <hi>Blair</hi> of <hi>Athole,</hi> to ſay nothing of his Wounds ſince in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was remov'd, till <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders conſidered his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials and Contract; and being call'd in again, <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> ſpoke to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

Jaque</hi> ſhould prove <hi>Mr. K.</hi> liv'd in <hi>Lithgo</hi> after that <hi>Mr. Wear</hi> had got the Church; or <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was to prove, he was living in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with his Family before that time) did not a little Confound <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> and put him to a ſtand; yet he quickly recover'd himſelf, and fell on <hi>Mr. K.</hi> far more briskly, than ever.</p>
                  <p>What has been your carriage, ſaid he, in former times, we ſhall not now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs: but I'm informed of very ſtrange things, you ſhould have done, ſince you came to this Country: They tell me that a woman came to your houſe in this Town, and father'd a Child on you. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was not in the leaſt mov'd with this Story; of which you ſhall have an account within a little. We go on to tell you of a ſecond blow, far more terrible, than the former; a blow indeed, that almoſt ſtruck <hi>Mr. K.</hi> dead to the ground.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo informed, continued <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> that you being in the Houſe of <hi>Sir John Home</hi> of <hi>Blakader,</hi> did ſtruggle ſo rudely with a young Woman, one of his Servants, that ſhe ſcreek'd and cry'd ſo terribly, that <hi>Sir John</hi> came running into the room, and reſcued her out of your arms.</p>
                  <p>With this <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was ſo ſurpriz'd, that he could not well open his mouth, till <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> again ſaid, and that with an <hi>Emphaſis;</hi> what ſay you, to this? I flatly deny it, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> whereupon, <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> immediatly deſired him to remove. Being call'd in again; The Seſſion, ſaid <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> is ſo difficulted in this matter, that they have referr'd it to the Presbytery. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> anſwered to this purpoſe: Sir, ſaid he to <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> As to the firſt of theſe crimes you have charg'd me with, I am not in the leaſt mov'd; I know certainly the buſineſs is a Cheat, and will be found ſo, if enquired into. But as to this other about the woman in <hi>Blakader,</hi> I am truly ſurpriz'd with it. 'Tis to me as if it had fall'n from the Clouds: And tho' I am as certain, as that I live, that I am Innocent in the matter; yet I do not know what Malice may do. And therefore I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg, before you carry the buſineſs any further, that you ſuffer me to go, or write to <hi>Sir John Home</hi> about the thing; and I doubt not but you ſhall get ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This moſt lawful Requeſt was flatly deny'd; not that they hinder'd

him to go, or write to <hi>Sir John</hi> (for <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> bid <hi>Mr. K.</hi> do in that as he thought fit) but they poſitively refuſed to delay the <hi>Reference.</hi>

                  <p>NOw know, that before <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was come out of the Church; yea, while he was yet ſpeaking to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders, the laſt Bell for Sermon was begun to ring, it being a day, wherein the Presbytery was to meet. Sermon ended, the Presbytery meets Immediately, and ſits about an hour and an half before dinner. Meeting again after dinner, they ſit two or three hours. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> being neither ſummon'd, <hi>apud Acta</hi> (in face of Seſſion) nor any other way; yea, not ſo much as deſired to attend the Presbytery; yet he reſolved to wait on, walking all the while in view of the Kirk-Officer. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very minute he expect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to be call'd in; a Gentleman all that time walking with him was exceeding weary, and often deſired to be gone, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſtill preſſing him to ſtay, till either the Brethren came out, or call'd him in. At laſt out they come; and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſtepping aſide towards them, <hi>Mr. Gaudy</hi> came up to him. After ſome little diſcourſe about <hi>Mr. Gaudy</hi>'s Sons, who were at <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s School, <hi>Was there any thing before you to day,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mr. K. relating to me?</hi> Yes, anſwer'd <hi>Mr. Gaudy, and we have referr'd it to the Synod, which is to ſit Tueſday next. What!</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> with a frowning countenance. <hi>Have you conſidered a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſo high a Nature, as Adultery, and Rape, or Force (for ſo it may be term'd as to my part) and paſt a Sentence, or Interloquitor thereon by referring it to a higher Judicature without Summoning, or calling the Criminal before you? Let me tell you, Sir, 'tis a very great Act of Injuſtice. The like has not been done by a Church Judicature to any perſon whomſoever. Give me but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the world. One Crime of this kind uſes to depend a Year; yea, may be two, three or four, before you. Wonderful! Lo, here two, that have paſt both Seſſion and Presbytery, and got into the Synod in one day; yea, perhaps within a few minutes: and all this without Citing, Summoning or Calling the alledg'd guilty perſon before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Was ever the like done by any Judicature on Earth, till now? No certainly The very Heathens would abhor ſuch a Procedure. The civiliz'd Roman</hi> Feſtus, <hi>poſitively refuſed to hear</hi> Paul<hi>'s Accuſers, till he was preſent to anſwer for himſelf. Really,</hi> Mr. K. <hi>ſaid</hi> Mr. Gaudy, <hi>we had not time to conſider all things. You know we have much to do on the Presbytery day before the meeting of the Synod. Suppoſe it true, you ſay,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr. K. judge you it fit, that a buſineſs of ſo high a Nature ſhould be managed in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion? Tho' you had ſit till night; yea, good part of the night, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Diet, you had but done your duty.</hi> Pray, <hi>Mr. Gaudy,</hi> Let me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the matter with you, either you duly conſider the thing, or not. If you did not; how could you refer to another Judicature a buſineſs which you had not duly conſidered? And if you did duly conſider it, why made you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, till you heard what I had to ſay for my ſelf? You did not know, whether I would confeſs, or deny the Crimes.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 'tis not poſſible, the buſineſs could be <hi>Duly</hi> conſider'd without the Accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed's preſence. Well, well, <hi>Mr. Gaudy,</hi> continued <hi>Mr. K.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, <hi>Exitus acta probat:</hi> We'll ſee what the event will be. And ſo they parted.</p>
                  <p>'Tis needleſs here to make Obſerves, or to draw Concluſions from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. He muſt be very dull, that ſees not through things ſo obvious to all that will but open their eyes. And if any thing does not yet appear ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the following parts of this Proceſs will more fully diſcover it to you. Give us only liberty here to tell you, that, if it had pleas'd the wiſdom of the Presbytery to have call'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> before them; 'tis hardly to be doubted (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all was reſolv'd and fixed before hand) but they would have given him

time to go to <hi>Sir John Home;</hi> And conſequently all the Trouble, the Clamour, the Miſchief and Evil that has follow'd, and may yet follow, would certainly have been prevented, that being the grand Point of the whole Proceſs. But what ſhall we ſay? The Secrets of the Almighty are unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out. Who knows, but all theſe things have come to paſs to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the view of the World the Craft and Cunning; the Hatred and Malice; the Hypocricy and double Dealing; the Pride and Uncharitableneſs; the Greed and Avirice; The Ignorance and Folly of Wicked men.</p>

                  <p>VVE go on to tell that <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s next work was to meet with <hi>Sir</hi> J. <hi>Home,</hi> which behov'd to be ſome time before the ſitting of the Synod; otherwiſe he was ſure to be ruined and diſgraced forever. His only comfort (under God) was, that ſuch a Worthy perſon, as <hi>Sir John,</hi> had a ſhare in the buſineſs, by being an Ear and Eye witneſs of the Action.</p>
                  <p>After ſome enquiry, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> is informed, that <hi>Sir. John</hi> was in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and to return home that week. To go to <hi>Edenburgh, Mr. K.</hi> thought he might miſs <hi>Sir John,</hi> and therefore he delays till Saturday, thinking the three days interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Ages. On Saturday he ſends an Expreſs to <hi>Blakader,</hi> about Twelve Miles diſtant, with a Letter, ſhewing the whole matter of Fact, word by word, as <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> ſpoke at the Seſſion Table, and how it went into the Presbytery, and out of that to the Synod. <hi>Sir. John</hi> was not come home, nor expected that night, being to come the Weſter Road; of which <hi>Mr. K.</hi> being inform'd about twelve a Clock at night, got out of Bed immediately, and wrote a ſecond Letter, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away with another Expreſs towards <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> tho' it was the Lord-day. This Letter was in general terms, ſhewing that there had fall'n out a buſineſs of ſuch moment, that unleſs he met with his Honour, between and Tueſday, he would be ruin'd forever; and that <hi>Sir John</hi>'s ſelf was alſo concern'd in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This ſo alarming Letter coming to <hi>Sir John</hi>'s hand at <hi>Stitchel,</hi> he was not ſlow to ſend an Expreſs to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> and he as ready at command. Being come to <hi>Stitchel</hi> (the very day before the Synod met; a wonderful Providence) he found <hi>Sir John Home</hi> and <hi>Sir John Pringle</hi> his Brother in Law alone in a Chamber, both very anxious to know what the buſineſs was. After a few Complements about one anothers health; <hi>I ſent, Sir,</hi> ſays <hi>Mr. K.</hi> to <hi>Sir</hi> J. <hi>Home, my Son in Law with this Letter, on Saturday to</hi> Balkader; <hi>and your Honour not being at home, he brought it back. You may be pleas'd to read it; for it will give you an Account of the buſineſs as ſuccinctly, as I can do by word of mouth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir John</hi> had not travelled far into it, when he lifts up his eyes, and hands to the Heavens. <hi>Sir</hi> J. <hi>Pringle</hi> ſtanding by was aſtoniſhed, at he knew not what; a meer ſhadow: but after he got the Leter to read, he found it to be a real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>What ſhall I do for you,</hi> ſays <hi>Sir</hi> J. <hi>Home,</hi> to <hi>Mr. K.? Shall I write to</hi> Mr. Jaque. <hi>You may do in that as you think fit,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr. K.

But, tell me, continued he, whether or not your buſineſs be to come in before Synod to morrow? That I know not, reply'd <hi>Mr. K.</hi> I am not Summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to compeat before them: Perhaps they may do before the Synod what they did at the Presbytery; they likely will not call me at all; but tranſmit the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the General-Aſſembly. My advice therefore, ſays <hi>Sir William,</hi> is, that you go juſt now to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and ask him, whether, or not, the buſineſs be to come in before the Synod; and come back and tell me. There were about thirty paces to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> goes ſtrait to his Chamber, and finds him and the ſaid <hi>Mr. Taylor</hi> very buſie; the one hearing, the other narrating what had paſt at <hi>Stitchel:</hi> But, as we ſay, <hi>Lvpus intervenit fabulae,</hi> Both were ſtruck dumb. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> without any long preamblet ask'd <hi>Mr. Jaque,</hi> if his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which, getting no anſwer, he again repeats his words, ſaying; Sir, I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg of you to tell me, whether or not I am to be call'd in before the Synod: I hope, Sir, you will excuſe me for being ſo preſſing, where I am ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: my reputation lies at ſtake. In ſhort, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> return'd to <hi>Sir. William,</hi> and told him, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> poſitively refuſed to anſwer any ſuch Queſtion. Since, ſaid <hi>Sir William,</hi> they will not bring in your buſineſs before the Synod, you muſt do it; and the fitteſt way is by a Petition: which accordingly was done.

And now a Miniſter being ſetled, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply's to Miniſter and Elders, craving their Concourſe in ſo far, as is competent to them. They inſtead of giving him a formal and legal anſwer to his Petition, did pretend they were informed, he was guilty of ſeveral moſt Horrid Crimes and Immoralities; and without the leaſt attempt to verifie the ſame, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately referred the buſineſs to the Presbytery; the Presbytery, without ſo much as once ſpeaking to him, or calling for him, put it into the hands of the Synod;

the Elders and others in the mean time ſpreading abroad through the Kingdom moſt dreadful and helliſh Calumnies, and defamations againſt him.

                  <p>Now know, that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was not cited to compear before the Synod; which is an Infallible ſign, that either the buſineſs was not to be brought in at all; or, if it was to come in before them, it would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by that Judicature, without hearing what <hi>Mr. K.</hi> had to ſay for himſelf; which is the height of injuſtice.

Pray, do not miſtake us: We ſay not, that the Synod would have paſt a final Sentence in the matter. All we aver, amounts to this, either the buſineſs was to be moved in Synod, or not; if not, he ſtill lay under the laſh of diſgrace, and infamy. If moved, he was to be called, or not; if call'd, he ought to have been cited, otherwiſe he is not obliged to compear. If not call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Synod would have done ſomething, or nothing in the Affair: if nothing, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſtill lay under the laſh of the Tongue; yea, and would have been in a far worſe condition than ever; becauſe the report, or news of his Crimes, became ſo much wider, as the bounds of a Synod ſurpaſſes that of a Presbytery, or Pariſh: And if they did ſomething in the matter; what a name, pray, ſhall you give that <hi>Something? A Sentence, Interloquitor, Dilature,</hi> &amp;c. So that, take things by what handle you pleaſe, you ſhall find great injuſtice done to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> if not by the Synod; at leaſt by Kirk-Seſſion, and Presbytery. But let us go on to tell, how the ſaid Petition went into the Synod, and what Reception it met with there.</p>
                  <p>The Synod meeting at the ordinary time, Sermon ended; <hi>Mr. Orock,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Haick</hi> choſen Moderator; they all go to Dinner. There <hi>Mr. K.</hi> is almoſt in every bodies mouth the main Subject of diſcourſe, things being induſtriouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd through Town and Country to diſgrace him, even by the Kirk-Elders, as you ſhall afterwards hear; and Wives in <hi>Kelſo</hi> repreſenting matters beyond what Modeſty can expreſs. <hi>If Sir John Home,</hi> ſay they, <hi>had not ſpeedily come into the Chamber by God's good Providence, and reſcu'd her out of his arms, he had certainly got his will of her,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of the Miniſters, Ruling Elders, their Servants, Probationers, Chaplains, <hi>Country-Dominees</hi> (as they call them) and others were all inform'd, both about the Buſineſs in <hi>Blakader,</hi> and the other about the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child: but as yet very few knew any thing about <hi>Sir J. Home</hi>'s Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. 'Tis not amiſs here, you know that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was altogether a ſtranger in <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> not one of 10000 having ever ſeen him, till he came to be School-Maſter at <hi>Kelſo;</hi> ſo that people were exceeding curious even to ſee the Man of whom they had heard much both Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>After dinner all did flock to the Church-yard, and ſtand here and there in Companies, till a Committee, which was then ſitting, ſhould riſe. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that people were very deſirous to ſee him, went out with two or three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades to the Church-yard, his Houſe ſtanding therein. His foot was hardly well over the threſhold, when he cry's, and he cry's; <hi>There he's; There he's. Whilks he? Whilks he</hi> ſays another? That in the midſt, anſwers the other. Some went found as if they found a Covey of <hi>Partridges,</hi> looking a ſquint to ſee his Face; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their Companions, ſaid; <hi>You's an old body, no queſtion he's paſt Fifty; they ſay, he's a Grandfather, and has a Daughter Married in this Town. 'Tis time

Mr. Semple</hi> anſwers, ſaying; <hi>Moderator, There are many, who live at a great diſtance, that have buſineſs before this Synod; and I think, they ought firſt to be diſpatch'd.

                              <p>THis day <hi>Mr. James Kirkwood</hi> Schoolmaſter, gave in a Petition, laying claim to be Precentor and Seſſion-Clerk to the Pariſh of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> founded upon a Contract, or <hi>Grant,</hi> made by the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and his Lordſhip's Curators; dated in <hi>Oct.</hi> 1694. which Contract he produced, and being read, the Seſſion took the ſaid Petition and Contract into their ſerious Conſideration; and <hi>Mr. Kirkwood</hi> being called in, the Miniſter and Elders declared their readineſs to pay all defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Noble <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and to the Noble <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and his Lordſhip's Honourable Curators, in ſo far as is Conſiſtent with the eſtabliſh'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government of this Church. And therefore deſired to be ſatisfied in a few things. 1. Whether he had preſented the foreſaid Contract to the Presbytery or not; and had the approbation of the Presbytery to be School-Maſter of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> conform to the Act of the General-Aſſembly, dated 7th <hi>Feb.</hi> 1645. To which he made Anſwer, that it was not <hi>Formally</hi> preſented; but <hi>Virtually</hi> by a Petition given in by the Bailyſſ of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> ſignfying the Subſtance of the ſaid Contract, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36252:17"/>
confeſſeth, that he had no <hi>Formal</hi> approbation conform to the ſaid Act, which was read to him. 2. Whether he was fit, or qualified to be a Precentor: and if he was content to ſubject himſelf to Tryal for that Effect. He ſaid, that he had more of Art, than a good voice; yet content to be tryed. 3. He was enquired, what Teſtimonials he had from the places of his laſt reſidence, <hi>Lithgo</hi> and <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> In anſwer whereto he produced one from <hi>Mr. Rule,</hi> Principal of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> College. Another from <hi>Mr. Alexander Seton,</hi> formerly <hi>Incumbent</hi> at <hi>Lithgo;</hi> but none from the Kirk-Seſſion of <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> nor from the preſent Miniſter of <hi>Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Seſſion, or Presbytery thereof. Alſo he produced a Letter of thanks from <hi>Mr. William Tullidaf</hi> for his Civility to his Wife and Family at <hi>Lithgo.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was told by the Miniſter, that the Reaſon of the Seſſions ſo particular enquiry of his behaviour in the places from whence he came, was a Fame that came to their ears of a Woman that came to <hi>Kelſo</hi> with Child, and charg'd him, as the Father of it, and went to him and ſpoke with him about it. He confeſſeth ſuch a thing was, and that a perſon came to him in the dark; but whether Man or Woman he did not know: and that ſhe told him ſuch a time before ſhe went over the water with him to <hi>Culroſs;</hi> and he ſaid that this was about five Months before, ſo that it was unreaſonable to think a Woman could be ſo near her time ſo ſoon: And alſo that ſhe offer'd that Child to <hi>Adam Bog</hi> Merchant; which was a way to get Money from either of them. And being queſtioned alſo; why he did not cauſe ſecure her for his Vindication; he ſaid that he went to <hi>Sir W. Ker</hi> and told him of it, who promiſed to cauſe ſecure her, if he could tell where ſhe was; but ſhe was gone before that time to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide, where ſhe brought forth the Child.

if ever there were any in the world: they ſpeak every thing you bid them, and nothing elſe. In ſhort, Moderator, it is all one thing, whether you take the Accuſer's Word, or Writings to Atteſt the truth of a Matter. If <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders, continued Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had read over to me, what they Recorded, which ought to have been done, and I had Subſcribed the ſame; that, and that only, would have made againſt Me; and not what they record at pleaſure. And further, Moderator, I could refer it to the Oaths of <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders, let them, if they dare, Swear upon their Eternal Salvation, that our communing at the Seſſion-Table was conform to the Contents of this Paper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate: I appeal to their Conſciences, if they can ſay, there was the leaſt motion of <hi>Sir J.

But, Moderator, if this Method ſhould be taken, that <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders ſwear upon the heads of the ſaid Reference; 'tis juſt that the Members of the Presbytery declare upon their Oath alſo, what was the ſubject of their Conſideration in this Affair; eſpecially ſince they were not pleas'd to call me before them; which was an act of great injuſtice. And, Moderator, continued Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that I may put an end to this point; I ſhall only adduce one other Argument, which may well paſs for a Demonſtration of the truth of what I have ſaid; and convince all the world that this Reference is a moſt Falſe, Lying, and Calumnious paper.</q> I offer, Moderator, to inſtruct, that <hi>Michael Fiſher,</hi> one of the Elders, and Clerk to the Seſſion, who wrote both <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s words and mine at the Seſſion-Table in the very moment they did drop from our lips. I ſay, Moderator, I offer to prove that <hi>Michael Fiſher,</hi> two or three minutes after he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus, and much more to this purpoſe Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſpoke in face of Synod. But, if he had then known what he came to know within a few days thereafter, he had <hi>Nettl'd Mr. Jaque</hi> and his Elders at another rate, for <hi>Sir J.

Then falling ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to work; firſt, to write over the Reference (for he could not do any thing to purpoſe till he put it into a better dreſs) and having ſcarce well begun, poring on it to get it read (for he could not have <hi>Michael Fiſher,</hi> writer thereof, to aſſiſt him, as the Moderator had advis'd) and leaning with his Arms upon the Table, the Pen did drop out of his Hand, and he fell ſound aſleep. 'Tis no wonder; for he had ſlept little or none in eight days and nights before, being mightily troubled about that Buſineſs in <hi>Blakader;</hi> the Candle all the while burning by him. But at laſt he awakes with no little aſtoniſhment, ſeeing both Candle and fair day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Nor knew he for a pretty while, either where he was, what he had been doing, or what he had to do. And after he had gather'd in his Thoughts, and was, as 'twere come to himſelf, his Body was altogether incapable to move, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſtiff as a Tree with cold, ſitting in a Room without a Fire; his Fingers not folding themſelves to hold the Pen. But above all things, the trouble of his Mind and Spirit with the Thoughts of not having ſufficient time to prepare Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt the meeting of the Committee, gall'd him to the very Heart. Have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got with ſome difficulty to his Feet, he took ſome few turns through the Room, as nimbly as he could, rubbing his hands one againſt the other, till he got Life again into them. Then falling to work, he ſcribl'd over the Reference, and made ſome few Remarks thereon, not ſo well digeſted, as otherwiſe they would have been, if he'd had more time. He kept not a double of the Paper, which he gave to the Committee; yea, he ſcarcely had time to read it over, after he had written it. The Heads or Scrole thereof, as a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of what he gave in, he has by him; of which, take this ſhort account at preſent, and you ſhall have ſome more hereafter.</p>

                                 </gap>he ſaid, his Contract was not preſented to the Presbytry <hi>in Ter; minis;</hi> but, which was equivalent, the <hi>Sum</hi> or Subſtance thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as concern'd the Presbytery to know, was repreſented to them in a Petition given in by the Baily, in name of the Earl and others. So that in effect, the Contract was intimated to the Presbytery in all parts neceſſary for them to know; as the ſaid Petition at more length bears, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Part</hi> 1. 3. As to that Queſtion, <hi>Whether, or not,</hi> he was qualified, or fit to precent in the Church:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36252:18"/>
he anſwer'd modeſtly, he was none of the beſt; he had Art, but his voice was not very pleaſant. And beſides, he added; that, if people were not pleaſed with him, he would ſubſtitute the School-Doctor. 4. As to that Queſtion, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not, the Presbytery had approved of his being a perſon duly qualified to be School-Maſter,</hi> according to that Act of the Gen. Aſſembly, 7 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1645. He anſwer'd, that the abovementioned Petition, given in to the Presbytery by the Baily, expreſly bears, that the Heretors were ſufficiently ſatisfied as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the ſaid Act, beſides other qualifications requiſite for one of his Office, leaving to the Presbytery to make what Enquiry and Trial they thought fit in that Matter. He added, that it was a ſufficient ſign of their Approbation, that 4 of 6 Members of the Presbytery (for there were no more) had put, two their Sons; one his Brother, the fourth a Friend to his School. 5. The account given in the <hi>Reference</hi> of his Teſtimonials is very defective; failing both as to their Number and Quality: of ſome it ſpeaks with diſdain; others it quite omits. As to his not having one from Mr. <hi>Wear</hi> in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> he told the Seſſion, that he was not Miniſter there in his time. So that things here in the Reference are exceedingly miſ-repreſented: For Mr. <hi>Seton</hi> was then preſent Miniſter; and not as Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders, both diſdainfully and falſely call him <hi>Formerly Incumbent at</hi> Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. And <hi>M. K.</hi> was not oblig'd to have a Teſtimonial from Mr. <hi>Wear,</hi> then Preacher in the Meeting-Houſe; much leſs from his Seſſion or Presbytery. 6. As to Mr. <hi>Tullidaff</hi>'s Letter mentioned in the Reference, <hi>M. K.</hi> did ſhew it to Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders, in face of Seſſion, to convince them of the falſhhood of that Report, which they ſpread abroad of him; <hi>viz. That he was always an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Presbyterians;</hi> or, as they expreſly word it in one of the Articles of their Libels againſt him (as you will ſee in its proper place) <hi>that at</hi> Lithgo, <hi>he was very offenſive to all that fear'd God:</hi> whereas he was very kind, and (if we may ſay it) liberal to them, when they were very low, and ſome in great ſtraits; as many that live in and about that Burgh, if need were, will atteſt. And as to this Worthy and Learned Perſon, one of the fineſt Men of that Party; know, that when he wrote this Letter to <hi>M. K.</hi> he was Priſoner in <hi>Blackneſs</hi> Caſtle, on the account of his ſtrict adhering to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles; his Wife and Children in the mean while living at <hi>Lithgo,</hi> about 2 miles diſtant. Now, <hi>Mr.</hi> Jaque and his Elders muſt of neceſſity, either ſay that Mr. <hi>Tullidaff</hi> was a Man, that did not fear God; or with ſhame retract what they libel againſt <hi>M. K.</hi> in the ſaid Point, and acknowledge his Converſation was not offenſive to all that fear'd God in that place. The truth of this. Aſſertion is moſt evident from Mr. <hi>Tullidaff</hi>'s own Letter, which we have thought fit to ſet down <hi>word by word.</hi>

He added alſo, that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders had given him ſo warm a drink, that truly he thought his Head a little light by it.

They came, ſaid he, on Saturday, and ſtaid all Sunday; but it was obſerv'd by the Servant Maid, who did not go to Church, but ſtaid at home to wait on the ſaid two Women, that they were exceeding curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tho in a cunning manner, to know where the fineſt things lay, and to ſee them. This being told to the Maſters of the Family, they concluded they were <hi>Cheats;</hi> and therefore Judge <hi>Couſton,</hi> the good man himſelf reſolved to watch all night, and to lie in a room next to theirs. The night, ſaid he, is not long: 'tis no hard buſineſs to watch one night. About the break of day he falls aſleep. The <hi>Jilts</hi> get up, and knowing where things lay, carry all away with them they were able to bear; the worth, they ſay, of about ten or twelve pounds <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money. After fair day light the <hi>Judge</hi> awakes, miſſes his Gueſts, looks up and down the Houſe, wants this and the other thing; his wife upbraids him, not knowing whether to laugh, or be angry at him: He is like to eat off his own fingers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Robb'd and affronted. Immediately he hounds out ten or twelve Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into all Quarters; two along the Coaſts, Eaſt and Weſt, the reſt through the Country: After no little Search they are got lying in a Sheep-Fold about five Miles off, near <hi>Dunfermlin;</hi> The <hi>Jilt</hi> big with Child was eaſed of her burden and as <hi>Swamp,</hi> ſaid <hi>John,</hi> as I am. In ſhort, all the Cloaths and Linens were got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that Child which they thought was in that Womans belly, was nothing but ſome Linens, which they had ſtol'n ſome days before in a Gentleman's houſe, who by this means got all his Goods reſtored.

Mr. <hi>K.</hi> heard all this with great attention; and after ſome deliberation he found no other Remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what evil might follow; but to go himſelf and watch her all night: for to bid Judge <hi>Couſton</hi> and his Wife to be wary of her, either they behov'd to ſhut her to the door; or watch her. By ſuch means he was ſure to be affronted, and ſpoken of by every body; and therefore, ſaid he, I'll rather go to Judge <hi>Couſton</hi>'s houſe, and watch there all night, than run the hazard of being affronted, and may ſuſtain great loſs beſides. With this out he goes, and into Judge <hi>Couſton</hi>'s, the two houſes being contiguous, ſo that he had not above ten paces between door and door. He tells the Judge and his Wife nothing of his Jealouſy he had of their Gueſt, but was very merry with them at a drink of Ale, and a dram or two of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebaugh,</hi> or <hi>Scots</hi> Waters, which truly were as pleaſant as hot water to him.

                  <p>He toſſed and tumbled all night, riſing frequently to look to the Doors and Windows. The Gentlewoman, whoſe Bed was within an Inch of his, told ſome perſons thereafter, that ſhe never knew in her Life ſuch a man: ſhe got no reſt for him the whole night, he was always going out or into his bed. Next day Mr. <hi>K.</hi> takes his morning drink with his Landlord, giving a ſhare to the ſtranger, after which he goes to the Palace to ſee the Earl, ſhe made towards her Uncle; and thus they parted till <hi>January</hi> thereafter, as you ſhall hear.</p>

                     </gap>hing, till he went to <hi>Culroſs</hi> in the following vacance, and it making very much for his vindication in the point under debate, he gave a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof in face of Synod, <hi>Oct.</hi> 1695.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of this Cheat, was as follows. The ſaid Judge <hi>Couſton</hi>'s Wife has only one Child, a Daughter, her Husband's Step-daughter, he having Married her a Widow, and has no Children by her; this Daughter was Married to Mr. <hi>John Mercer</hi> School-Maſter at <hi>Culroſs;</hi> who about the beginning of the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being turn'd out of his Office, went to <hi>London,</hi> and there got an occaſion to be Chaplain to a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (as is above related) taking his Morning drink with the Judge and his Wife, the Stranger alſo ſitting by, enquired, when they heard from their Son-in-Law, <hi>Maſs John,</hi> as they uſed to call him. We have got no account from him, anſwer'd the Judge, theſe four years and more. He wrote a Letter to his Wife, that he had got an occaſion to be Chaplain to a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and was juſt going aboard; ſince that time we have heard nothing of him, and therefore we conclude that he is dead: This is all that paſt on that Subject. Now know, that Mr. <hi>John Mercer</hi>'s Father is a Farmer of very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, living in <hi>Pawmil</hi> of <hi>Adie</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Hoſway,</hi> about ſix Miles from <hi>Culroſs.</hi> The Stranger, or Cheat, not yet fully inſtructed in all Points and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances neceſſary for her deſign, turns a little aſide into a Houſe, after ſhe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36252:21"/>
was gone out of <hi>Culroſs,</hi> where ſhe gets a full Information of every thing, that might be ſerviceable to her purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>After this ſhe goes ſtrait to <hi>Pawmil,</hi> and with great confidence enters the houſe of the ſaid <hi>John Mercer;</hi> and tells him, ſhe was ſent Expreſs from his Son <hi>Maſs John,</hi> who, ſaid ſhe, bleſſed be God, is ſafe returned again to his own Country; and is in <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> The honeſt old Man's heart warm'd within him, when he heard his Son was alive. She confirm'd all ſhe ſaid with ſuch Tokens, that there was no ground left for any doubt, at laſt ſhe added; <hi>Ay, but I muſt tell you, Sir, that he is ſtill the old Man: the world cannot make him hold his tongue. Being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany one day, he ſpoke ſome things about King</hi> James, <hi>and the Prince of</hi> Wales; <hi>for which he was carried to the</hi> Cannon-gate, Tolbooth: <hi>But, Praiſe to the Almighty, he wants not good Friends to ſpeak for him; he may come out when he will, if the Good-Man of the</hi> Tolbooth, <hi>and the Officers were ſatisfied. He bid me tell you alſo, that he is not in that Condition you would him, when he comes home to his Friends, neither as to his Cloaths nor Linens; and therefore he deſired you either to ſend him money to buy in</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>or Cloth and Linnen to make things there.</hi> Immediatly the honeſt ſimple Man ſent to <hi>Dunfermlin,</hi> and took off Cloth, and what other things were to be had there; and what neceſſaries could not be got in that Burgh, he ſent Money to buy them in <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> as alſo to pay his Sons Dues in Priſon accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Information: Nor did ſhe let him forget to ſatisfie her ſelf, giving her four Shillings ſterling for her pains. All theſe things were ſent, not with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Servant, but with a Neighbour; one, whom Mr. <hi>Mercer</hi> thought he could truſt: The Woman alſo went along with this Man, riding forſooth on a Horſe like a Gentlewoman.

All you and I have both will not fully ſatisfie the Priſon Dues; the Keepers of the Priſon are I confeſs, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſcreet: they are content to take what we have to give them at preſent, and</hi> Maſs John's <hi>obligation for the reſt. 'Tis no great Sum he will be due. He ſent me out, you ſee, to get him Paper, Pen and Ink; and deſired I ſhould take into him all the Money we have, with the Cloath and Linens; and he will come out immediately. He has no will that you go into him; leſt they ſeek you to be Cautioner: And when they ſee what fine things his Father has ſent him, it will make them the more willing to take his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for what reſts.</hi> The Country Man believ'd all ſhe ſaid, as his Creed, and thus ſhe went out with her arms full, but forgot to return. After that the poor man had ſit, till he was weary; poor indeed, for ſhe had left him nothing; yea, not to pay the Ale and Bread he and ſhe had eat and drank in the place; at length deſpairing of her return, he with another man went up to the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> and ask'd, if one <hi>Maſs John Mercer</hi> was Priſoner there. <hi>Maſs John Mercer,</hi> reply'd the Keepers! We never ſaw, nor heard of ſuch a Man. Now we leave you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what ſtrange thoughts this poor deluded Soul had; how he look'd, what he ſaid when he went home to the old Man; who with his Friends and Neighbours were all expecting and longing to ſee him, whom they had given over as loſt. O what a conſternation, think you, would it be to the Aged Father a Widower! What to the Father and Mother-in-Law? But eſpecially to their Daughter, his Wife, who had mourned ſome years as a Widow; and on a ſudden put in full hopes of her Husband, and immediately again diſapointed? Poſterity will call this a Perfect Comedy, or Romance. If you be curious to know matters more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, you may ask the Perſons above named.</p>

                     <hi>JAn.</hi> 1693. <hi>Patrick Johnſton,</hi> commonly called <hi>Paty Peers,</hi> a Fruit-Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> meeting (as is ſuppoſed) with the ſaid Woman in <hi>Lughton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> near <hi>Dalkeeth,</hi> agreed with her for ſo much to carry her to <hi>Kelſo.</hi> She was (at leaſt ſeem'd to be) big with Child; yea, ſo near her time, that he almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd to get her out of <hi>Lawder,</hi> where they ſtayed all night, he Maintaining her all along the Road, and ſhe aſſuring him, that ſhe was to receive enough at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> naming this and the other Perſon, that were owing her. They come to the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's houſe in the <hi>Floors</hi> (hard by <hi>Kelſo</hi>) about Sun-ſet on Saturday. <hi>Come Patrick,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>Let us ſtep in here a while, and take a drink: I have no will to go into Kelſo till it be dark.</hi> And indeed, they ſay, ſhe took a hearty drink there, <hi>Paty</hi> paying all. After it was a little dark, he brings her to the Houſe of <hi>Nichol Somervale,</hi> where all the Whores and Thieves were wont to lodge. In ſhort, having ſtayed there till Monday, ſhe comes about nine a Clock at Night to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s door, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exceeding dark, that one could hardly ſee another a Pace diſtant. Now here lies the ſtreſs of the whole buſineſs; the very hinge, whereon the ground of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Accuſation (as to this point) does depend. All the Preceding Paſſages in the two former Parts are adduc'd upon this head. We ſhall therefore be a little particular, and as plain, as poſſible; tho' we cannot repreſent matters in ſo lively a manner with Pen and Ink, as they were acted by that ſubtil Woman. Know then that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was returning from Convoying <hi>Sir W. Ker</hi> to the Boat (the thing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out that day, wherein Mr. <hi>Gaudy</hi> informed <hi>Sir William</hi> of the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Act paſt in the Joynt Presbytery at <hi>Jedburgh</hi> in Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Favour; of which <hi>Sect</hi> 10. <hi>Part</hi> 1.)

What are you,</hi> anſwer'd he? <hi>Do you not ken me,</hi> reply'd ſhe? <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Oho are you? I am ſure you ken me;</hi> anſwered ſhe; pronouncing the word <hi>Me,</hi> with great <hi>Emphaſis.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> began to take Pet, and therefore in a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing manner he ſaid; <hi>Tell me plainly, Woman, who you are. Do you not remember,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, and with that ſtop'd? <hi>Remember what,</hi> ſaid he? <hi>That once you and I croſs'd the Ferry from</hi> Borrouſtoneſs <hi>to</hi> Culroſs, quoth ſhe; <hi>and how I told you that I had lain long in Priſon. Are you the young woman, that was once ſervant to</hi> Sir W. Ker, <hi>and carried Letters to My Lord</hi> Ballantine, <hi>when he was in</hi> Edenburgh <hi>Caſtle?</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr. K. Yes, yes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, with a mighty low voice, bidding him, <hi>St,</hi> or ſpeak low; <hi>Yes, I am her, Well, What's your will with me,</hi> ſays he? With this ſhe ſtopt a pretty while; till he again ſaid, <hi>Speak Woman.</hi> At laſt (as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it) whiſpering to him; <hi>I'm with Bairn,</hi> quoth ſhe. <hi>Baſe unworthy woman,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>What am I concern'd with that?</hi> and immediately left her, and went into his houſe, and inſtantly told his wife all that had paſt. Next morning he went over to <hi>Sir W. Ker,</hi> and inform'd him of the whole buſineſs. <hi>She is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Cheat,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>for there's not one true word of what ſhe ſays relating to me.</hi> And ſo he ordered her to be apprehended, but ſhe prevented that by leaving the Town before day-light next morning, after ſhe had ſpoken to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> without taking her leave of her Landlord, or paying one Farthing for her Quarters. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Johnſton</hi> alſo, who brought her to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> was cheated both of his hire and disburſments, beſides his great travel and pains, in making enquiry for her in the <hi>Engliſh-ſide</hi> among the Midwives, but all in vain; for ſhe return'd that ſame day back to <hi>Smellom,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> as Swamp, they ſay, as an Eel, and worſt of all, cheated <hi>Kobert Dickson,</hi> Carrier in <hi>Smellom.</hi> We ſhall conclude this point by ſhewing you, that ſeveral Perſons in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> of good Note have of

                  <p>'TIs no hard task to collect from the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> what uncertainties, Falſhoods, and Lyes, are to be ſound in the above written Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, relating to this Cheat; of which, take theſe few. 1. 'Tis moſt falſe that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> confeſt, that the ſaid Woman did charge him, as Father to her Child; and ſuppoſe ſhe had ſaid ſuch a thing, and he acknowledged ſhe ſaid it, what then? 2. He had no ſuch Expreſſion; as, <hi>That it was unreaſonable to think ſhe could be ſo near her time,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaid, it was not poſſible in nature ſuch a thing could be, except by way of Miracle; ſuch as that God can raiſe up Stones to be Children; for there were but three Months Excluſive, ſince he had ſeen that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at <hi>Culroſs:</hi> All which things were ſpoken in Face of Seſſion by way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition only. 3. He ſaid not, ſhe was gone to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-ſide, or that ſhe brought forth a Child there; but that ſome talk'd ſo: And it was afterwards found, that ſhe was neither with Child, nor did go to <hi>England,</hi> as the abovenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Paty Peers</hi> can atteſt to his great loſs. 4. He ſaid not, that ſhe offer'd the Child to <hi>Adam Bog;</hi> for ſhe did not ſpeak one word of him, nor mentioned his name to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> He ſaid indeed, that he heard ſhe had named <hi>Adam Bog</hi> to ſome Perſons in the Town. 5. Here in the <hi>Reference,</hi> and all along in the Proceſs, as you will hear, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is challenged for not cauſing ſecure this Woman.</p>
                  <p>'Tis anſwer'd; He us'd the ordinary and legal means by informing, and that with all conveniency the Principal Magiſtrate of the place; one, who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concern'd in the thing. And certainly, no wiſe Man would have adviſed him to fall a ſtruggling with her in the dark under the Cloud of Night; eſpecially conſidering, that he could prove nothing againſt her: In ſuch a Surprize, he did all that was incumbent on him. This Challenge, or Accuſation for not cauſing ſecure the ſaid Woman could not have come ſo ill from any man on Earth, as from Mr. <hi>Jaque:</hi> He ſees a <hi>Mote</hi> in his Neighbours Eye, but cannot diſcern the <hi>Beam</hi> that's in his own.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall paſs here that Famous buſineſs, which fell out in his houſe at <hi>Biggar,</hi> being a thing generally known through the Kingdom; how, <hi>viz.</hi> He let go one <hi>Madam Stones,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, Couſin, as they ſay, to his Son's Wife, who brought forth a Child in his houſe, and that, as the common report went, to his own Son. This <hi>Madam Stones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> did let go out of his houſe without bringing her before any Judicature Eccleſiaſtical or Civil; which Affair we ſhall paſs here, tho' it well deſerves a ſevere Touch, being a buſineſs accompanied with ſome very dreadful Circumſtances; and give you a ſhort account of a Paſſage ſomewhat in Kin to it, but by far more wonderful; if upon no other reſpect, at leaſt for its <hi>Singularity,</hi> which fell out in his houſe at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> July, 1696.</p>

Had ſuch a thing been done in ſome houſes in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> the very ſtones of the Church-wall had heard it. Much about that time, when this was done, Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> ſpeaking in Pulpit of the Uncleanneſs of the place, ſaid; <hi>If there was a Town in the World like</hi> Sodom, Kelſo <hi>was it.</hi> But little did he

                              <p>Know then, that before <hi>Martimus,</hi> 1696. Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> had two Servant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the one <hi>Margaret Shiel,</hi> commonly called <hi>The Good-Laſs,</hi> ſo ſtrait lac'd, as to her Principles, that ſhe diſdain'd to ſpeak with any not of her Communion, carrying toward Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his Family, as if they had been <hi>Barbarians;</hi> yea, as Perſons infected with the Peſt, or Plague: The other <hi>Iſabel Maiſon,</hi> not a Good-Laſs; becauſe ſhe carried Diſcreetly and Neighbourly.

But this grip'd faſt by <hi>Davies</hi> heart with a <hi>Philtrum,</hi> or <hi>Love-Potion,</hi> the like was never heard of in the days of our Four-Fathers. Moſt cunningly was it contriv'd in all its parts, being made up of three Ingrerdients; <hi>viz.</hi> Sweet, and thick ſowre Milk, with ſome other ſtrange myſtical-like kind of a thing, in Colour ſomewhat reſembling Scarlet: This <hi>Potion</hi> was given <hi>Davy</hi> in his bed, within a dark Vault at a good diſtance from any Perſon. What real ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it had upon him, we cannot vvell determine. But 'tis certain, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to three Perſons, that ſhe got as much from him, as he vvas able to give a Woman, (ſo ſhe vvorded it) vvhich made Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> ſend him (tho' he deny'd it) as vvell as her, avvay vvithout a Teſtimonial. Yet he entertained in Bed and Board this vile and abominable Strumpet from <hi>July,</hi> till after the Term of <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> And 'tis certain that Mrs. <hi>Charity,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi>'s Grand-Child and the other Servant-Woman knevv it; yea, ſavv the <hi>Philtrum</hi> that ſame night it vvas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but vvith Candle-light only: yet took a better vievv of it, at leaſt of its dregs next Morning by the help of the Sun-Beams, and told <hi>Davy</hi> of the hearty Affection of his Sweet <hi>Miſtreſs;</hi> vvhereat he was like to Vomit both Gut and Gall, as we ſay. Mrs. <hi>Charity</hi> inform'd her Grand-Mother, and ſhe her Husband ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before term, and yet that vile Woman was kept till the time ſhe was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, which would have been, tho' that had not fall'n out. No anſwer can be made to this, unleſs you ſay; That 'tis a buſineſs of ſo abominable and hateful a nature, that it ought not to have been revealed, nor made publick: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> acted moſt Prudently, and Chriſtianly in concealing it. 'Tis true, when the thing firſt came to his ears, he was much offended, ſaying he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of ſuch a vile Whore in his life: ſhe deſerv'd to have her Noſe ſlit up, and ſcourg'd through the Town. And yet he ſuffer'd her to go away without any kind of Puniſhment. To this we anſwer; If Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> acted Prudently and Chriſtianly in this matter; he and others carried moſt Maliciouſly and Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly in a buſineſs of that kind. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (ſay they, as you will hear in its place) did expone and explain to his Scholars the word <hi>Menſtrua.</hi> This, tho' a moſt Helliſh Calumny, Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> and others have publiſh'd far and wide, proclaiming it aloud in all the Church-judicatures of <hi>Scotland;</hi> as you ſhall hear. 'Tis more than probable, that ſome Perſon has expon'd and explain'd alſo, the ſaid word to that vile-woman; and told her its true Nature, Quality, and Virtue; and what effect it can produce, otherwiſe it can hardly be ſuppoſed, that one of her Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances could fall on ſuch a device. When Mrs. <hi>Charity</hi> and the other Servant-woman did challenge this <hi>Good-Laſs</hi> for the <hi>Ill Deed. What mean you, woman,</hi> ſay they to her; <hi>deſign you to poyſon the man?

                  <p>MR. <hi>K.</hi> is not Ignorant, what ſome people talk of him; <hi>viz.</hi> that he makes it his buſineſs to ſeek out all Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi>'s failings: Truly he needs not travel far to get them. Pray tell me, who they are, that ſpeak much to his commendation? Certainly very few that know him. And who knows him not in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland?</hi> As to the foregoing Paſſage, Mr. <hi>K</hi> ſought it not, it was told him by three or four Perſons without being ask'd; yea, it was current through the Town, and had got footing in the Country alſo, before that he knew: And if things happen to come to his ears, who can blame him if he make uſe of them, when they ſerve his turn? 'Tis not his Cuſtom, nor humour to believe Stories and Tales; and if he be concern'd, he narrowly enquires into things before he gives Credit. There's hardly any thing in Nature more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that they who Calumniate their Neighbour, ſhould be offended, that he takes a legal means to vindicate his own Reputation. And without all Queſtion every man is more obliged to defend his own good name, than another can be to rob him of it; the one thinking he is Innocent, the other not: He that wards off blows, is far more excuſable, than he that gives; if he can by lawful means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them. Some are ſo void of all ſenſe and reaſon, that like little Children, they are angry forſooth, you ſtand not ſtill, while they beat you. This truly is Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Caſe in many Points. But Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> fails not to ſail all winds to get In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> What vaſt numbers of Letters has he ſent through the Kingdom, where Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has been living? To <hi>Edenburgh, Lithgo, Culroſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In Summer 1696, he wrote a Letter to <hi>Frazer</hi> of <hi>Braes,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Culroſs</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout forty Miles diſtant) earneſtly preſſing him to make enquiry about matters. <hi>Braes,</hi> either forgetting or ſlighting the thing; Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> writes a ſecond, and ſends it with a ſure hand, Mr. <hi>Webſter,</hi> one of the Miniſters of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> who went to <hi>Culroſs</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Braes</hi> at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. We need not be ſolicitous about the return of this Letter; for certainly, if it had been to Mr. <hi>K</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s prejudice; we ſhould have heard of it: and in juſtice being otherwiſe, it ought not to be conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>He wrote alſo to Mr. <hi>Wear,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Lithgo,</hi> and got a return, which is claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the witneſſes, and adduc'd againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> And yet, when he preſt once and again, that Mr. <hi>Wear</hi>'s Letter ſhould be produc'd and read in Publick, Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> poſitively refus'd it: Of which more in its place. How many he wrote to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> we know not; only we are certain of one, a moſt Wicked and Helliſh Letter, which providentially fell into Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s own hands; and is now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Proceſs before the Lords: Of which hereafter. Now let all the World judge what Principle moves a man to be thus ſolicitous to find out the Failings he <hi>Alledges,</hi> or <hi>Thinks</hi> (for certain <hi>Knowledge</hi> he cannot have) his Neighbour may be guilty of. Pray, can it be any other Principle, than <hi>Malice, Envy,</hi> or the like? And yet Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders, to name no more, are mightily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (who knows certainly, whether he be guilty, or not) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the uſe of Lawful means to vindicate himſelf from their Calumnies. They call him, as you will afterwards ſee, <hi>Litigious, Contentious, Malicious,</hi> &amp;c. Pray, conſider, that they are ſtill <hi>Pelting</hi> at him with Libel after Libel; as you ſhall ſee in the three following Parts. Poor Man! Does not Nature oblige him to ward off the ſtrokes, as well, and as long, as he is able; for, if he ſhould ſtand ſtill and receive blows, they would immediately end his days: Or yet, if he ſhould caſt away his Weapons (as ſome of themſelves adviſe him; of which in its place) and betake himſelf to his heels, he would be alſo a dead man; for you know the common ſaying, <hi>He that that flyes, takes the guilt upon him.</hi> The true and natural Order of things obligeth them firſt to deſiſt; and by an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

And that which makes the thing much more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is, that they themſelves are the Diſcoverers of their own wicked Invention; like the Rat or Mouſe in the <hi>Comedy,</hi> which by gnawing on the wood awakes the Enemy to its Deſtruction: <hi>Terent, Eun. Act.</hi> 5. <hi>Sc.</hi> 7. All this you will clearly ſee from what follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You may remember, what a dreadful Crime Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> ſitting in Judgment with his five Elders did lay to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Charge; viz. <hi>That he ſtruggl'd ſo rudely with a young Woman in</hi> Sir John Home <hi>of</hi> Blakader<hi>'s Family, that he made her cry ſo terribly, that</hi> Sir John <hi>came running into the Room, and reſcued her from him.</hi> See <hi>Sect.</hi> 10 and 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Know that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders now deny, that they ſaid, that <hi>Sir John</hi> came into the Room, and parted Mr. <hi>K.</hi> from the Woman; but that <hi>Sir John</hi> being in his Cloſet near by the Room, wherein Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was ſtruggling with her, his ſtirring within his Cloſet parted them. See <hi>Sect.</hi> 14 and 15.</p>
                  <p>Now, that we may proceed orderly in ſo material a part of the Proceſs; know that the Point incumbent here on Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to prove, is; that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> ſitting in Judgment with his Elders, ſaid, that <hi>Sir John Home</hi> came into the Room, and parted him from the Woman, with whom he was ſtruggling. Further know, that tho, it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that this is not ſufficiently prov'd; which, we hope no indifferent Perſon will think, but that it is: Yet, grant 'tis not; even in that caſe Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders are ſo far from being innocent in the matter, that inſtead of one, they become guilty of many moſt Horrid and Malicious lyes; to paſs that, when one wicked Device fails, a ſecond highly aggravates the Crime. The Points therefore, which Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders ought to make good, are theſe ſoar.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſtruggled with a Woman in <hi>Sir John Home</hi> of <hi>Blakader</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. That <hi>Sir John</hi> was in his Cloſet near by at the time. 3. That he ſtirred in it. 4. That his ſtirring parted Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and the Woman.</p>

                  <p>WE return to the abovementioned Point, which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> ſaid <hi>Sir John</hi> came into the Room, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You are to call to mind, when the <hi>Reference</hi> of the Seſſion was read in Synod, the Moderator asking Mr. <hi>K.</hi> what he had to ſay againſt it, he reply'd, that it was a moſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, Falſe and Calumnious paper; that there was ſcarcely a true ſentence in it. And particularly ſpeaking about this point under debate, he ſaid, he could refer it to Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders Oaths, whether or not they ſaid that <hi>Sir John</hi> came into the Room, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, whether or not there was any mention of his being in his Cloſet.

The Perſons, to whom theſe words were ſpoken, <hi>viz. William Moody</hi> Book-Binder, and <hi>Marg. Halywel</hi> his Wife, known to be two very honeſt folk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of good eſteem, both born in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and have liv'd therein all their life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſtain; each of them being ſeventy four Years of Age, and Married together fifty three Years: He the Son of Mr. J. <hi>Moody,</hi> School-maſter, Seſſion-Clerk and Precentor in <hi>Kelſo</hi> above forty Years, <hi>viz.</hi> From 1612, to 1650, a Preacher alſo of the Goſpel, and that frequently at <hi>Kelſo.</hi> 2. Know alſo, that a minute or two after <hi>Michael</hi> was gone, it happened that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> went into the ſaid houſe, about four or five paces diſtant from his School; and finding the old Man and his Wife amaz'd at he knew not what, asked them, why they look'd to ſtrangely one to another? We are aſtoniſh'd, ſaid they, at the news we have juſt now heard of you from <hi>Michael Fiſher;</hi> and we know not, whether to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them or not. You are the Perſon, who can beſt put us out of doubt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had repeated, once and again, the ſaid <hi>Michael</hi>'s words, as above rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: This is a matter of great Conſequence, ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and very probably will come to publick; and you two may be called to declare upon Oath what you heard <hi>Michael</hi> ſay in the matter; and therefore, 'tis my advice, that you inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in writing the very words you heard him ſpeak: Now, I ſay, while they are freſh in your memory, that if you ſhould be call'd to depone ſome Months or Years after this, you may do it with as great freedom, and clearneſs, as you can do at this minute. Immediately the ſaid <hi>William</hi> took Pen and Ink, and wrote down the individual words above related; which when he had done, he read them to his wife, both of them proteſting moſt ſolemnly, that they were clear and ready to confirm by Oath before any Judge the Contents of the ſaid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whenever they ſhould be call'd. 3. Know that ſome little time after this, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> commenc'd a Proceſs againſt the ſaid <hi>Michael;</hi> cauſing him to be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd before the Commiſary of <hi>Peebles</hi> ſitting at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> as a <hi>Calumniator;</hi> and was to have adduc'd the ſaid <hi>William</hi> and his Wife, as witneſſes of the Calumny: But while the Proceſs was depending, <hi>William</hi>'s wife Died. Yet by the good Providence of God, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> got about thirty ſix hours before her Death, her moſt ſolemn Declaration, in preſence of two publick Notars and Witneſſes, expreſly bearing, as ſhe ſhould anſwer to God, before whom ſhe was within a little time likely to appear, that <hi>Michael Fiſher ſaid to her Husband and her, that</hi> Sir J.

If not at home, not in his Cloſet; if not in his Cloſet, ſtirr'd not in it; if ſtirr'd not in it, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was not parted by his ſtirring. Theſe are <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> as ſtrong, as any in <hi>Euclide.</hi> Now, if any perſon affirm for certain Truths, four ſeveral Points (eſpecially Matters of Fact) and three of them be as falſe, as Falſhood it ſelf, that's without any mixture of Truth in them) is any man, think you, oblig'd to believe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point upon their bate word? 'Tis needleſs to make application in a matter ſo clear in it ſelf. We only deſire by way of <hi>Suppoſition</hi> to ask Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders a few Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe therefore, that <hi>Sir J.

Did any of you ſee <hi>Sir John</hi> in his Cloſet, or heard you his voice? Certainly none of you will of dare ſay it. And further, tell us how you came to know, that <hi>Sir John</hi> ſtirr'd. What kind of motion made he? Roſe he up to walk, or did he beat on the floor with his foot, or ſtaff, that a ſervant might come to him? Laſtly, how know you that his ſtirring parted Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and the Woman? Did he deſiſt as ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Sir John</hi> ſtirr'd, or was it a little after? 'Tis pretty odd indeed, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a very hot purſuit heard <hi>Sir John</hi> ſtir, and yet <hi>Sir John</hi> heard not him ſtruggle and wreſtle with a Woman in a Chamber-floor. But, ſince neither you your ſelf, nor any of your Elders, do ſo much as pretend to have been Eye, or Ear witneſſes to the abovemention'd four Points; it follows by all abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that either ye came to know them by the Information of others; or ye your ſelves are the Forgers and Contrivers thereof: for we think, ye do not lay claim to <hi>Divine Inſpiration;</hi> and for <hi>Magick, Sorcery,</hi> or the like, we know you will diſown. Now if by Information, pray ſhew us who upon Earth is the Perſon, Man or Woman, that dare affirm ſuch things. Produce but one ſingle Witneſs and you ſhall gain the Cauſe. But ſince this you cannot do, have we not juſt ground to think, and ſay, that ye are the Forgers of theſe moſt Helliſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies? Helliſh indeed we may well call them; being invented on deſign to ruin a Man and his Family: to rob them both of their good Name and means of living. Such horrid lyes are certainly no leſs odious in the ſight of God, than theſe we call <hi>The crying ſins of the Land;</hi> ſuch as <hi>Adultry, Murder,</hi> &amp;c. No queſtion, that Lye which <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife made of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was as diſpleaſing to God, as her Inclination, and attempt that he ſhould lie with her. Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> This you will find cloſe Arguing: Win through it if you can. We defie the Wit of man to find out an Evaſion. You, and your Elders think your ſelves with thoſe of your <hi>Gang</hi> the only Saints of the place; whereas in effect ye are down right Hypocrites, exactly reſembling the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> againſt whom our Saviour pronounces ſo many <hi>Woes. They payed Tithe of Mint and Cummin; but omitted the weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, and Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. St. Mat. 23.23. And do ye not the like; if not much worſe? Your Elders are ſent out on the Lords-day after Sermon to take notice, what perſon is walking in the fields, and to call them before you for ſo doing; yea, you cauſe them challenge poor old rotten wives, for ſitting at their Doors upon a Turff, or Stone, to take the benefit of the wholeſom air, who

perhaps can hardly, without being ſuffocate, ſtay within for Smoak, and other ſort of Naſtineſs. And which is yet more remarkable, ye rebuke Women, that ſit at Doors with Infants on their knees, tho' they tell you that the innocent Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies will by no means ceaſe from exceſſive weeping within the houſe. In plain terms, ye are a ſtain to your profeſſion, and a great reproach to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> It may be juſtly ſaid of you, as of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in old time; <hi>Ye ſtrain at a</hi> Gnat, <hi>and ſwallow a</hi> Camel.

                  <head>A word to <hi>Michael Fiſher,</hi> one of the Elders and Seſſion-Clerk beſide.</head>

                  <p>
                     <hi>MR. Fiſher,</hi> 'tis a wonder you have a Countenance to look a honeſt man in the face. You a Recorder of <hi>Divine</hi> Truths! Yea, much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Forger of damnable Lyes. We ſhew'd you in the former <hi>Section</hi> three ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groſs and palpable ones, without the leaſt ſhadow of Truth in them, knit up in one bundle; which with many hundreds are now inſerted in all the Church Regiſters of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But that which we here mainly charge you with, is falſe and double dealing. You write one thing in your <hi>Reference,</hi> and tell your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour another. In a word, your Pen contradicts your Tongue: your tongue your pen: and both are moſt horrid and malicious lies. You told two very honeſt perſons that <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> came into the Room, and <hi>Sundred</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtruggling together. You may know your <hi>Dialect,</hi> you ſounded it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>Scots</hi> way, <hi>He Sindered them.</hi> Theſe are the very words which you ſpoke, while they were freſh in your memory, and as yet warm upon the paper, which you had written two or three Minutes before. Ay but after that you were inform'd, that <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> by his <hi>Declaration</hi> had call'd your words a <hi>malicious Lye,</hi> and conſequently, you and your Complices are <hi>Malicious Lyars;</hi> immediately you turn'd your tongue, and chang'd your pen, laying and writing, that <hi>Sir John</hi> came not into the Room indeed; but was in his Cloſet hard by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That you ſaid, he came into the Room, two very famous witneſſes have declar'd; the one in a moſt ſolemn manner, even as ſhe was ſtepping into <hi>Eternity:</hi> the other is ready to ſwear upon his Eternal Salvation that you ſaid it. Now, <hi>Michael,</hi> be ingenuous; confeſs, or deny, as you pleaſe, it comes all to one thing: 'Tis but out of the <hi>Dub</hi> into the <hi>Mire,</hi> as we ſay. Firſt you ſaid, that <hi>Sir John</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That's declar'd to be a <hi>Malicious Lye.</hi> Next you write, that he came not into the Room, but was in his Cloſet near by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly this is a Lye alſo; for he was not at home. <hi>Michael, Michael,</hi> this is a ſore <hi>Dilemma,</hi> a very hard <hi>Lock</hi> you are put to. Take it by what handle you pleaſe, it will bite ſeverely. Acknowledge your ſin; and firſt crave God's pardon, and next thoſe, whom you have injured, and adviſe your Brethren to do the like; eſpecially your eldeſt Brother, Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> who leads you all by a <hi>Noſe of Wax</hi> into crooked Paths.</p>

                  <p>THat nothing may be wanting on our part for clearing this Point of this Plea, which has made ſo much Noiſe through the Kingdom, we ſhall here give you an account of that Paſſage, which they ſay gave occaſion of this calumnious report rais'd againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> which we do not out of any Principle of Duty, or any other neceſſary Tye incumbent on us; but rather as a work of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,</hi> and to ſatisfie ſome Peoples Curioſity.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> according to his Cuſtom once a year in the Vacance-time, having travers'd the <hi>Lothians</hi> and ſome other places of the Kingdom, at laſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36252:25"/>
came to <hi>Blakader,</hi> where he was made very welcome by theſe two worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> and his Lady. After Supper Mr. <hi>K.</hi> taking his leave of them ſignified he would take horſe next morning, he thought before they roſe; and therefore ask'd, if they had any ſervice he could do them in theſe places he was going to. I will not ſuffer you to go away, ſaid <hi>Sir John,</hi> till after dinner. In the fore noon, you and I ſhall ſtep over to <hi>Allan-Bank,</hi> and ſee <hi>Sir Robert Stuart.</hi> To which deſire Mr. <hi>K.</hi> condeſcended, and thus they parted that night. Next morning <hi>Sir John</hi> comes pretty early to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Chamber, before he was out of his Bed, ſaying, <hi>I muſt beg your pardon, Mr.</hi> K. <hi>I cannot wait on you this day, for there are three or four of my Tenants down ſtairs preſſing me to go tithe their Corns; my Servant that uſed to do it has got a fall, whereby he has disjoynted his arm. That's a buſineſs of Conſequence,</hi> Sir John, <hi>anſwer'd Mr.</hi> K. <hi>it needs no Apology.</hi> In ſhort, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> gets up, and within a little is called down to break-faſt, <hi>Sir John</hi> making haſt to go to tithe. Immediately after break-faſt he takes horſe, his Lady and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> going to the Gate with him. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> return'd again to his Chamber to take off his Hair, having got a loan of <hi>Sir John</hi>'s Razors. This being done, he goes to put on a clean Cravat, being to viſit ſeveral Perſons of Honour in the <hi>Mers.</hi> Of all the Cravats he carried from <hi>Kelſo,</hi> he finds one only clean; but ſo abuſed and wrinkled, that he could not put it about his neck in the caſe it was in, and therefore he gives it to one of the Servant-women, deſiring, that ſhe would be pleas'd to ſmooth it, which accordingly ſhe did, and brought it back to his Chamber. All he can remember, that paſt between him and her, was, that ſhe asking how her Miſtreſs (the Laird of <hi>Throgtons</hi> Siſter, whom ſhe had ſerv'd in <hi>Kelſo</hi>) and Mrs. <hi>Kirkwood</hi> kept their health; he anſwer'd, very well, praiſed be God, and thanking her for the ſervice ſhe had done him, they parted. Now know that this Woman was of Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s acquaintance at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> having ſerved the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Ker,</hi> who liv'd about ten or twelve paces only from Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and to whom he frequently payed viſits. Know alſo, that Mrs. <hi>Jennet Home, Sir John</hi>'s Siſter, was all the while in a Cloſet within the Chamber where they were, unknown to either of them, and heard every word they ſpoke. Laſtly know, that both Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> and the ſaid Servant flatly deny what Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders charged Mr. <hi>K.</hi> with. And thus you have got a true account of this Malicious Calumny.</p>

                  <head>§ 28.</head>
                  <p>NOw, ſince 'tis certain, even to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> that there are moſt Horrid Lyes and Calumnies forg'd againſt Mr. <hi>K</hi> in the matter above related; the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, who are the forgers thereof. That we may proceed the more orderly in this Point, we ſhall firſt lay down theſe few Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis incumbent on all men to endeavour the preſervation of their own, and neghbours good name, as far as they can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To forge Lyes to diſgrace and ruin our neighbour is a grievous Iniquity, and the more groſs they be, and the more publick they are made, the Sin thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the more atrocious: The Cirrumſtances alſo of the Perſons <hi>Injured</hi> and <hi>Injuring</hi> (which in this preſent caſe are very conſiderable) do exceedingly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Crime.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Calumniators be puniſh'd according to their demerit, is moſt juſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All lawful means ought to be uſed to find out the Calumnator.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He, who knows the Calumnator, is partaker of his Crime, if he conceal him when required to detect him; but more eſpecially, if he brought the Calumny to publick before a Judicature. Since therefore, 'tis beyond all debate that Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are forged againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> it neceſſarily follows, that he ought to enquire who are the Forgers: And certainly they are either the Members of Seſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders, or ſome other perſons; or both. If they be the Members
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36252:26"/>
of Seſſion, you cannot but acknowledg, that they deſerve ſevere puniſhment. If they have things by Information, they are obliged to give their Informers, that they may be puniſh'd conform to their Crime. And (which is by far the moſt likely of the three) if the Members of Seſſion have been told only a part of the abovementioned Lyes, and if they have added the reſt themſelves, or have made things worſe, than were told them; in that caſe both are to be look'd on, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Helliſh Calumnies, tho' the Members of Seſſion deſerve the pre-eminence. Now know, that when Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders are required to give their Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, they anſwer; <hi>They are not obliged: 'Tis not their Cuſtom.</hi> Hardly any thing can be more unreaſonable, than this anſwer; and have more ſad effects accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, as you ſhall clearly ſee from what follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It gives juſt ground to think, that they are the Contrivers of the ſaid Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in whole, or part. 2. It implies great partiality; they favour the guilty more than the innocent. <hi>Neither do they, as they would be done to.</hi> 3. If it be ſuſtained that a Kirk-Seſſion is not obliged to give their Informer, in that caſe no man can be ſecure of his Reputation, or Office, if it be in their power to deprive him thereof. For any perſon, whether a Member of Seſſion, or not, who has En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Malice, Prejudice at his Neighbour; or, who would have himſelf or his friend, or a relation ſetled in his Office, may inform the Kirk-Seſſion, or any of its Members againſt him without fear of being called into Queſtion upon the matter. The Seſſion is not obliged to tell, how they came by ſuch a report. You may ſafely ſay; this or the other man is guilty of Fornication, Adultry, Inceſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſtruggl'd with ſuch a Woman, and had certainly got his will of her, if he had not moſt providentially been parted from her ſo, and ſo. In a word, you may ſpeak of this kind what you pleaſe without being challeng'd for it: The Kirk-Seſſion is not obliged to give you up for their Author. Or, you may take a more hid and private way. Whiſper into ſome perſons ear, who, you know, will devulge it; <hi>That ſuch a man is too familiar with this or that woman, you ſee them often alone together; you do not like ſo great familiarity,</hi> &amp;c. This is enough to ſome perſon. He tells it to two or three more with ſome little addition. They do the ſame. Preſently it becomes <hi>Fama Clamoſa.</hi> Then the Church takes hold on't; eſpecially if he be a perſon they may meddle with, or would fain have a hit of. Being Summon'd before them, he craves to know their Informer. <hi>We are not oblig'd,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to tell you who inform'd us.</hi> They adduce for Witneſſes, the Informers themſelves, contrary to all Law and Reaſon. And thus an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man may come to great trouble, vaſt expence; yea, be turned out of his Office, ruined and diſgraced, he, and his forever: And the riſe and occaſion of all this may be, Envy, Malice, Avarice, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now there is no way under Heaven left to avoid this, but ſeverely to puniſh Calumniators. And how, pray, ſhall we come to know them? Unleſs you give your Informer, and he his, till we come to the Fountain and Root of all; to him who ſet it firſt a work, and by this means you ſhall come to know the thing from its very birth, or firſt conception, with all the encreaſe it received from this and the other hand. And if any perſon ſhould report a Calumny, and cannot give his Author; perhaps has forgot from whom he heard it; or may be knows his Author, but he denies it; and the other cannot inſtruct that he ſaid it: This man is puniſhable by Law. There is no other Remedy in Nature left us to preſerve our good Name. 4. If the Kirk-Seſſion be not obliged to give their Informer, this bad Conſequence will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> moſt Atrocious and Heinous Crimes ſhall paſs without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One out of Malice, or Revenge, raiſes a Calumny on his Neighbour; ſaying that he is guilty of Adultery, Inceſt, Beſtiality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you be not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to delate this man, as your Author, he paſſes unpuniſhed, and certainly his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36252:26"/>
Sin is as odious in the ſight of God, as that which he chargeth on his neighbour. We told you already, that we have ground to think, that that revengeful Lye, which <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife made of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is no leſs grievious a Sin, than her attempt ſhe made on him to lie with her. And to let the greateſt of Sins paſs without puniſhment is certainly horrid iniquity. We might here add, that the not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing his ſin in this life, may perhaps be the occaſion of his eternal Damnation in the life to come. 5. It opens a door for people to commit the moſt Atrocious Crimes without any reſtraint, having a kind of aſſurance their ſin will never come to publick, they venture on it with the greater freedom. 6. People are thereby deprived of the juſt and lawful means, whereby they might purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Crime, they are charged with. Who knows, but perhaps it could be inſtructed, that either the Informer, or the alledged guilty Perſon was <hi>Alibi,</hi> (that is ſome other place) when ſuch a thing was ſaid to be done. An inſtance of this kind you have again and again above-related; Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſtruggling with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was parted by <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> ſtirring in his Cloſet near by. <hi>A moſt abominable Lye,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir John</hi> in face of the Synod; <hi>for I was not then at home.</hi> And thus we have ſhewed you ſufficient ground, why you ought to give your Informer. Pray, give us your Reaſons why you are not oblig'd to do it? We know none worth the naming. Perhaps ye would ſay, if ye durſt tell it; <hi>He is a friend that inform'd us, one of our own Party; He told it as a Secret, and we promiſed not to bring his Name into publick,</hi> &amp;c. The very Heathens will riſe up againſt this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Generation, and condemn it at the great day. <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Ariſtoteles, ſed magis amica eſt Veritas.</hi> Tho' he be your Father, who inform'd you, he ought to be delated in this Caſe. 'Tis far better he be puniſhed, and perhaps to ſave his Soul, than that <hi>Truth</hi> be ſuppreſt, and the Innocent ſuffer.</p>

                  <p>YOU have had in the two former Parts, ſeveral very extravagant and wild Paſſages: But you may aſſure your ſelf, that you ſhall have in

this and the two following, a great many things very far ſurpaſſing all you have yet heard. Yea, we dare promiſe to ſhew you ſome things infinitely beyond, what you are able to conceive in your mind. Infinitely, we mean in its moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and proper ſignificacion. Never, yea never certainly in this world was there heard of ſuch a monſtrous, and wonderful kind of Judicature, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, as you ſhall find ſat upon the 24th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 95. Nor were ever any Judges before guilty of ſuch horrid and wicked Crimes; ſuch Illegal, Informal, Unjuſt, Fooliſh, and Ridiculous acts, as they committed the ſaid day; of all which you ſhall have an account in their proper places. Only here we muſt not omit to tell you, that we are very far from aſcribing theſe wild and exorbitant actings to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Member of the Committee. No, no, not the half of them. Theſe worthy Gentlemen above nam'd, with not a few of the aſſiſting Brethren, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have abhorr'd to fit amongſt the actors of ſuch groſs Enormities. Know that there was only one Aſſiſting Brother preſent at that Meeting. Alas, alas, it has been Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s great misfortune, that Gentleman kept not Diets. Many never came and ſome very ſeldom, of which you will now and then have a touch, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offers; We now proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Committee meeting the ſaid <hi>ult.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> pretty frequent, none being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, except Mr. <hi>Semple,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crock,</hi> Sir J. <hi>Pringle, Torwoodlie,</hi> and <hi>Buckam,</hi> and yet nothing was done. The reaſon pretended, was Mr. <hi>Semple</hi>'s abſence, who, as you heard, was ſent to the Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſs of <hi>Roxb.</hi> to ſee if her Ladiſhip would be reconciled to Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> by which means all differences might be taken away; this being the chief thing recommended to the Committee by the Synod.</p>
                  <p>You all know very well, ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to the <hi>Moderator,</hi> what kind of Reception Mr. <hi>Semple</hi> got from the Counteſs. How her Ladiſhip poſitively refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> into her preſence, tho' ſeveral Perſons of great Quality were very preſſing for it.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>K.</hi> not prevailing by this, further added, that by their not proceeding he ſtill ſay under the laſh of malicious Tongues, and was deprived of the Profits due to him by Contract. This had no influence on them. By the way know, that if her Ladiſhip had been pleas'd to countenance Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> immediately Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had appear'd, free of any vice; ſound from the crown of his head to the ſole of his foot. Many time he had this offer made him, that if he could gain the C. all his ſores ſhould be inſtantly clos'd up. This he told her Ladiſhip once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; adding that he was far from deſiring her to do any thing inconſiſtant with her Honour, and the truſt her dear Lord had committed to her, whatever might become of him. We return to our purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>WHen nothing, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> could ſay to the Committee, prevailed to make them proceed in the Proceſs; that his Appearance before them might not be altogether in vain, he propos'd to them ſome very neceſſary <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,</hi> and took <hi>Inſtruments</hi> thereupon, both in the hands of their Clerk, and of a Publick Notary, in each 4 or 5, the <hi>Sum</hi> whereof follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He asked, if they were a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and what number made one. And if they were, he crav'd he might be formally proceſs'd according to Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that an Informer, and Accuſer might be condeſcended on; and that other legal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods be taken to find him guilty, or not. If not guilty, that he be abſolved, and have the extract of his Abſolviture given him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He crav'd, that they might proceed only as to the Points contain'd in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovewritten <hi>Reference,</hi> and that no other Accuſation ſhould be received againſt him, till theſe were diſcuſt; for he was hearing, that the Members of Seſſion, having fail'd ſo Groſly in the Main Points of their former Charge, eſpecially in

the buſineſs of <hi>Blakader,</hi> which was their <hi>Plight-Anchor,</hi> were about contriving a new Libel; which they did, as you will hear. He alſo here proteſted, that if they ſhould ſucumb in their probation, they might be liable to <hi>Lex Talionis</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. He crav'd to know, if there was an Act made or a Commiſſion and Power given by the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> appointing <hi>William Chriſty,</hi> or any other of the Elders to Collect the Profits belonging to the Offices under debate; to which he had Right by vertue of his Contract. And alſo he deſired to know, if the ſaid <hi>William Chriſty</hi> or any other had made any account of their Intromiſſions, and to whom; and proteſted that the ſaid Ittrometters, or Collectors, and their <hi>Conſtituents,</hi> whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were, might be liable to refound the ſame, both as to time paſt, and to come, during their Intromiſſion, and his Incumbency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Inſtruments</hi> at more length bear.</p>

                  <p>'TIs moſt proper here to inſert a very odd Paſſage, which gave occaſion to the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxb.</hi> to Commiſſionate ſome perſons to appear before this Committee, or any other Church-Judicature, that might happen to ſit and cognoſce on this Proceſs, within the bounds of <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> to ſee that nothing ſhould paſs there in prejudice to his Lordſhip's Right.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that on the 23d of <hi>April</hi> (8 days before the meeting of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee) Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Ednim,</hi> came to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s School-door, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him out, paid his Brothers School-wages. After ſome communing, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ask'd, when the committee was to meet, telling, he longed exceedingly to have that Scandalous buſineſs put to an end. <hi>The day is not yet determined,</hi> reply'd. Mr. <hi>T. You will get notice, when it will be.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did not in the leaſt doubt but that it was Truth, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpoke, conſidering he was Clerk to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the Synod left to them to appoint the Diet, and give Advertiſement to the Aſſiſtants. This fell out on Tueſday, and on Friday thereafter late at night Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is certainly informed that the Diet was appointed at <hi>Ednim,</hi> within the ſaid Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Church at a <hi>Viſitation</hi> there, 8 days before the ſaid Tueſday; and that Letters were ſent to the Aſſiſtants, ſhewing, they were to meet the ſaid <hi>ult. Apr.</hi> We need not make Inferences here from Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s carriage in this matter. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all the World, that his deſign was to attack Mr. <hi>K.</hi> at a diſadvantage, <hi>viz.</hi> to give him as little time, as they could to prepare himſelf for Battle. Know alſo, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was told by a Gentleman, who was at the ſaid <hi>Viſitation,</hi> that all the Miniſters there preſent had formally engaged and promiſed ſtill to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here one to another, till they got him turn'd out. We dare not compare this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Combination to that moſt horrid and dreadful one mentioned 23 <hi>Act.</hi> of thoſe perſons, who bound themſelves by a Curſe, not to eat nor drink, till they had kill'd St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Yet, tho' this in moſt reſpects comes far ſhort of that, in ſome regard it does very much exceed it. That was done by a Rabble of rude igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant fellows; This by theſe who call themſelves Ambaſſadors of Jeſus, met in the houſe of God in order to advance the great ends of the Goſpel. As there the Apoſtles took a moſt prudent way to diſappoint theſe wicked men of of their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deſign; ſo here Mr. <hi>K.</hi> that he might put himſelf in as good a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as he could, by the good Providence of God fell upon the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; which with the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty has been the chief means to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through the many dangerous Paſſages of this Plea. As there the Apoſtle could not have eſcap'd the fury of that Multitude, without the Aſſiſtance of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36252:28"/>
chief Captain; ſo here Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had certainly been ſwallowed up amongſt the midſt of the waves, if he had not been ſtrongly ſupported by not a few moſt Honourable and Worthy Perſons. This you will acknowledge, before you come to the end of this work.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Method he took was this. That ſame night, wherein he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the two abovementioned paſſages about eleven a Clock he provides a horſe, and having taken journey next morning very early, was at <hi>Broxmouth</hi> (the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> his houſe) before nine in the Morning. He was not long in getting Acceſs both to the Earl and Counteſs to whom he ſpoke at large: The <hi>Sum</hi> whereof relating to this preſent Affair, was, that the Presbytery of <hi>Kelſo</hi> with the Elders there had already encroached too far on the Earl and other Heretors their right in matters relative to the Offices of School-Maſter, Seſſion-Clerk and Precentor; and to the Profits thereto belonging, and to ſuffer them to run on at this rate, would certainly at length not only raze and deſtroy their Right in that matter; but tend to the great diſadvantage, if not to the ruin of the place: For to diſ-unite and divide the ſaid Offices, and ſquander the Profits appointed for the encouragement of the Maſters and Teachers of the School, could not but at laſt produce that effect. <hi>And, My Lord,</hi> continued Mr. <hi>K. This right to preſent one and the ſame individual perſon to all the ſaid Offices, your Lordſhip and the reſt of the Heretors have peaceably poſſeſt not only paſt Preſcription (which gives a ſufficient right, at leaſt till a civil Judge determine otherwiſe) but beyond the memory of any man brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This Right cannot be taken from your Lordſhip, without the Sentence of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Judicature in the Kingdom, if you pleaſe to carry the Cauſe before them. And, My Lord, I humbly beg your pardon, if I ſpeak yet more freely to your Lordſhip. Since, I ſay, you derive this Right from your Noble Predeceſſors, one after another for many Generations; Pray, My Lord, what will People think, and ſay, if you let it ſlip thro' your fingers? Eſpecially conſidering what ſort of Cattle they are, who would wreſt it from your Lordſhip: your own Tenants and Servants, who will triumph over you, when they have gained their point. They have too too much Honour already, in that they dare enter the Liſts with your Lordſhip, and debate for what is not theirs. But ſhould they carry their deſign, they would become inſolent beyond all meaſure; ſo that it would become hard for any to live in peace and quiet by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that, My Lord, which makes the thing the more abſurd, is, that they are both Judge and Party, by aſſuming to themſelves</hi> (B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>evi manu, <hi>forſooth) that right which paſt memory of man has been lodg'd in your Lordſhip and your Noble Predeceſſors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And turning towards the Counteſs, he ſpoke to this purpoſe. <hi>As to your part, Madam, every body does acknowledge, that hitherto you have managed the Earl's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, not only to the ſatisfaction, but to the admiration of all, that hear the ſame; ſo that many other Worthy and Honourable Ladies in this Kingdom have taken your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for their Pattern in the managing their Childrens Fortunes. But, Madam, I muſt take the freedom to tell your Ladiſhip, that if you ſit ſtill, and ſuffer this Feather to be pluck'd out of the Earl's wing, you ſhall loſe very much, and that deſervedly, of your former Reputation. Yea, Madam, 'tis that, which you cannot do. You may not do it. And to uſe yet greater freedom; Madam let me tell you, 'tis that which you dare not do. 'Tis altogether inconſiſtent with your Truſt; for not only the Earl's Honour and Intereſt, but your own is at ſtake: Your Ladiſhip ought to be called to an account for it, if you uſe not legal and juſt diligence in the matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, a Commiſſion is immediately drawn up, and ſubſcribed by the Earl and his Lordſhip's Curators, giving power to <hi>Gilbert Ker,</hi> Brother German to <hi>Sir William Ker</hi> of <hi>Greenhead,</hi> and to <hi>Allex. Potts,</hi> Writer in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> or to either of them to appear before the ſaid Committee, or any other Judicature within <hi>Mers</hi> or <hi>Tivio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Right. Which Commiſſion was peſented to the Committee by the ſaid <hi>Allex Potts,</hi> and Inſtruments taken thereupon <hi>ult. April,</hi> abovementioned. He proteſted alſo that the ſaid <hi>Dilature</hi> of the Committee, or any other <hi>Dilature</hi> to be made by the ſaid Judicature might no ways pre-judge, or impede the Earl of <hi>Roxb.</hi> and his Curators, and other Heretors concern'd in the Pariſh of <hi>Kelſo;</hi> or Mr. <hi>K.</hi> or others in their names to proſecute a <hi>Declator</hi> of the Right of Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſaid Offices; and for the Emoluments, Caſualities, and Perquiſites thereto belonging, not only as to By-gones, but in time coming, as the ſaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> at more length bear.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have got a brief Account of what was done before the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, <hi>ult. April</hi> 95. Only reſts a little Paſſage, that fell out that Evening, of which you will have a touch or two hereafter, referring you back to this place.</p>
                  <p>The matter is this: Mr. <hi>K.</hi> being deſirous to meet with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> waited till he went out of Town homeward; and then did caſt himſelf into his way, and Convoy'd him more than half a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall then be plain with you,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>K. You know, Sir, that this day eight days at my School-door, when I ask'd you, when the Committee was to meet, you ſaid that the day was not yet condeſcended on; tho' you knew it was done eight days before; and that at a Viſitation in your own Church. Well, Well,</hi> Mr. T. <hi>you thought to have ſurpriz'd me, but by the good Providence of God, I am thereby in a better poſture of defence than I was. What was deſign'd for my hurt, tends now to my advantage.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> you may be ſure, being not a little damp'd with theſe words, at laſt ſaid, <hi>He knew not, but the Presbytery might alter the Diet. Yes, Yes,</hi> replied Mr. <hi>K. and write Letters</hi> De Novo <hi>to the Gentlemen:</hi> For all the Aſſiſtants were advertiſed by Letters ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days before Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s firſt communing. <hi>And ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>MAy</hi> 1695, the Commitee meeting again this day, after a very long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, ſent their Officer for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and deſired to bring him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately at a back door; which Mr. <hi>K</hi> refuſed to do, ſaying, he was not aſhamed to go in at the publick Entry. <hi>You are to take none with you,</hi> ſaid the Officer. <hi>I muſt go with him,</hi> ſaid Mr. Potts, <hi>by vertue of my Commiſſion. I am forbid to ſuffer you to enter,</hi> replied the Officer. <hi>If I be hindred to go in with Mr.</hi> K. anſwered Mr. Potts, <hi>I will proteſt and take Inſtruments that the Earl's Commiſſion is rejected by this Committee, tho' received by the former.</hi> After ſome debate he was permitted to go in.</p>
                  <p>We have ſent for you, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſaid the Moderator, to enquire, whether, or not you have acquainted the Counteſs of <hi>Roxb.</hi> with your Affair by Letter or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Moderator, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Mean you before Mr. <hi>Semple</hi> ſpoke to her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhip or ſince? Before I ſpoke, replied Mr. <hi>Semple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moderator, ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> before I give an Anſwer to your queſtion, be pleaſed to know, 1. That I was certainly informed that her Ladiſhip had got an account of my buſineſs, and that very much to my diſadvantage; <hi>viz.</hi> That I was convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Adultery, and had confeſs'd it in face of Seſſion. As alſo, that <hi>Sir John
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36252:29"/>
Home</hi> had come into the Room upon me, while I was ſtruggling with one of his Servant Women, and that I certainly would have forced her, if he had not by Providence come quickly into the Chamber and parted us. This the Counteſs did know the very day, in which the buſineſs was before Seſſion and Presbytery; at leaſt ſoon the next Morning. 2. Know alſo that I was not only deſired, but ordered by a Perſon of Honnour, who was concerned in the buſineſs, to give her Ladiſhip a true account of the whole Affair; which accordingly I did by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a day or two after the ſitting of the Synod. Immediately Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and being call'd in again, was told there was no more to be done that day; and that he ſhould be advertiſed ſome days before the next meeting. He told the Moderator plainly, that he thought he had juſt ground to be diſſatisfied with their Proceedure. They did nothing the former Meeting, becauſe Mr. <hi>Semple</hi> was abſent: and now when he is preſent, 'tis all one thing. There are ſeveral of our number abſent, anſwered Mr. <hi>Semple.</hi> If you never proceed, replied Mr. <hi>K.</hi> till you be all preſent, that may be <hi>Ad Graecas Calendas,</hi> or <hi>Nevermas:</hi> and ſo I muſt live and die in diſgrace, and infamy. And therefore, Moderator, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe again to you the ſame <hi>Queries,</hi> which I had in the former Meeting; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether, or no, you are a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and what number makes one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe, are very pertinent and neceſſary <hi>Queries.</hi> I earneſtly deſire to be ſatisfied in them. When nothing, he ſaid, could prevail with them, he again proteſted, and took <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> as he had done at their former meeting. You ſhall hear in its place, what a ſtrange and wonderful kind of a <hi>Quorum</hi> pleaſed them, <hi>viz.</hi> one ſingle Aſſiſtant; and only one, at moſt two Members of the Presbytery. It ſeems they were waiting for ſuch a <hi>Catch.</hi>

                  <p>There reſts here a very remarkable paſſage, which may be of great uſe, as to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> all along this Proceſs. 'Tis as follows. Moderator, ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave to know, Whether, or not, that <hi>Query</hi> you put to me, when I was firſt called in, and my Anſwer thereto, be recorded. Yes, anſwered the Moderator, both are recorded. Then ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> you muſt excuſe me, Moderator, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that, what you have recorded may be read to me. This was poſitively refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, eſepcially by Mr. <hi>Semple,</hi> who, as we told you, is <hi>Inſtar Omnium.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> preſs'd hard to have it done, uſing many Arguments for it; particularly telling them, how much he was wrong'd by recording things <hi>amiſs</hi> before the Kirk-Seſſion, which made him always jealous thereafter. Nothing he could ſay, did prevail with them. Now, we leave to the World to gueſs, what could make the Committee refuſe to grant ſo lawful and innocent a Requeſt. Either they had faithfully recorded the matter, or not. If faithfully; pray what evil was there to let Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hear it read? If not, it was a great Act of Injuſtice done him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis good he is not obliged neither in Law or Reaſon to ſtand to what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>

On which day Mr. <hi>K.</hi> being call'd in before the ſaid Committee, was told, he was to have a <hi>Libel</hi> given him, to which he was to make an Anſwer in writing againſt that day eight days; and to receive on the ſaid day a liſt of witneſſes; and the Libellers to anſwer that day fourteen days being the third of <hi>Sept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwered, that his Scholars being to get the Vacancy on the 23d. then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he had appointed to meet with ſome perſons at <hi>Edenb.</hi> on the 26. of the ſaid Month about buſineſs of concern; and that ſome of theſe were Perſons of Honour, whom he might not diſappoint. And thus not without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he got the buſineſs delayed till the 10th of <hi>Sept.</hi> Now pray tell us what you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36252:30"/>
judge, could move the Members of the Presbytery, and a few of the Aſſiſting Brethren, puſh'd on by Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders to be ſo preſſing, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhould ſit in the heat of Harveſt, and that weekly, and yet were ſo ſlack; yea, did nothing <hi>April, May, June, July,</hi> till the 20th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Certainly thought they, Gentlemen, and ſome others, who are (we will not ſay <hi>Indifferent</hi> in the matter) but <hi>

And it was ſo indeed, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (a wonderful Presbytery, as you ſhall hear) and one ſingle Aſſiſtant did what they pleas'd on the 24th of <hi>Sept:</hi> then next. They then laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a moſt unjuſt; yea, rather of a black and helliſh Sentence; for in effect, as you will ſee in its place, they fetch'd a Coal from the loweſt pit of Hell to be its Ground-work.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>K.</hi> humbly craves of the Reverend Members of this Committee, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Additional Libel be entred on, the two chief Articles ſtated before the Seſſion, Presbytery and Synod may be firſt diſcuſs'd; and that the other Heads contained in his Inſtruments taken before this Committee <hi>ult.

                     </gap>od, eſpecially, ſeeing many of the Heads of this Libel are civil Matters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fall not under the Inſpection of this Judicature. Yet, tho he Judgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no ways obliged to anſwer any other Article, till theſe two be firſt discuſs'd, leſt he ſhould be thought altogether refractive in this matter, he humbly offers the following returns to what is further laid to his charge; and begs liberty to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36252:30"/>
premiſe, that where ſome of theſe Articles, at leaſt many Points and Branches thereof, are in general terms, it muſt not be expected that particular Anſwers can be given, till particulars be condeſcended on. Neither can every little <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>Twig</hi> ſprouting from the main Articles receive proper and particular returns: By that means this work might encreaſe to a Volume.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Article,</hi> 1. That in his Petition to the Synod, he doth moſt ſlanderouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Seſſion of the Church of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> as guilty of forging Helliſh Inventions to divide and break his Family, in pretending ſeveral moſt uncharitable and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious Defamations, and Immoralities, that he was guilty of; and that by the Proceedure of the ſaid Seſſion, his Family ſuſtains great Scandals: for which it is humbly conceived they have given no ground, either by their <hi>Reference</hi> to the Presbytery of his Affair, or any other way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This he denies and oppones the <hi>(A)</hi> Petition, craving it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and read. That Helliſh Calumnies are forged againſt him; he ſaid, and ſtill does ſay, laying at the Kirk-Seſſions door to give their Informers; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt be pardoned, if he look on them as Contrivers thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remark, (A)</hi> 
                     <q>The Sum of this Petition you had <hi>Sect.</hi> 13 <hi>Part</hi> 2. And you are to have a large Account of a very odd Paſſage relating thereto, <hi>Sect.</hi> 21 of this Part, and a touch alſo of it, <hi>Sect.</hi> 16, <hi>Part</hi> 4.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 2. That he did publickly in the face of the Synod charge all the Elders of <hi>Kelſo</hi> to be his Enemies: For which, 'tis humbly conceived, they never gave him juſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Circumſtances of this being conſidered, no man will blame him for ſaying the Elders were his Enemies. Mr. <hi>Semple</hi> frequently abovementioned tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Moderator, that the word of the Elders was to be taken in a matter rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Records of Seſſion. No, reply'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> for they are <hi>Enemies;</hi> that is, <hi>Parties, Oppoſites,</hi> or <hi>Adverſaries.</hi> A very common Expreſſion at ſuch occaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 3. That he denied openly before the Synod, what he had owned, and confeſs'd before the Seſſion Judicially, and is Recorded in their Regiſter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he appears to be unfit for humane Converſe; much more for a place of ſuch Truſt, as Clerk to a Church-Seſſion, or Precentor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This he flatly denies. All he ſpoke in face of Seſſion, he adheared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Synod. What they Recorded, he knows not; it never having been read to him. And can inſtruct their <hi>(A)</hi> Recorder, one of his Accuſers, wrote at the Seſſion-Table, and Subſcribed one thing with his hand, and ſpoke with his tongue the contrary within a few minutes thereafter in a matter of preſent agitation. Neither Law, nor Reaſon oblige him to ſtand to what they Record; unleſs it be <hi>(B)</hi> read to him, and he ſubſcribe the ſame; eſpecially in matters of ſo high mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and where he has juſt ground to ſuſpect the Recorder and his Complices.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> 4. That he hath no Teſtimonials from the Kirk-Seſſion of <hi>Lithgo,</hi> where he reſided many Years, and for ſome time, after Mr. <hi>Wear</hi> was reſtor'd to the Church for which reaſon he is not capable to be precentor, or Seſſion-Clerk in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required by the 13 Act of the <hi>Gen-Aſſembly</hi> againſt <hi>Prophaneſs,</hi> that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who remove from one Pariſh to another have ſufficient Teſtimonials; much more Perſons, who lay claim to ſuch an Office.</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36252:31"/>
which Teſtimonial was thought ſufficient by the Miniſters of <hi>Edenb.</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided two years and an half, and brought from that City two ſufficient Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials; one from <hi>Doctor Rule,</hi> in whoſe Pariſh he liv'd: another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He reſided in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> ſays the Libel, for ſometime after Mr. <hi>Wear</hi> got the Church. This he poſitively denies; and confidently <hi>(C)</hi> affirms, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with his Family to <hi>Edenb. (D)</hi> many Months before Mr. <hi>Seton</hi> was put from his Church, or Mr. <hi>Wear</hi> entred it. What ſhould move Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders thus to preſs this point, Mr <hi>K.</hi> cannot imagine. In face of Seſſion (12 <hi>March</hi> 95.) Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> enquiring for a Teſtimonial from Mr. <hi>Wear;</hi> He was not Miniſter in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> anſwer'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> in my time. That cannot be, reply'd Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> for <hi>(E) &amp;c.</hi> After ſome diſcourſe on this head; Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>K.</hi> There's no need of any debate about this Affair. If it can be inſtructed, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus ended that debate before the Seſſion. Yet it came in again in their <hi>Reference;</hi> and now the third time in this Libel.

                  <p n="3">3. Here's an Act of the <hi>Gen. Aſſembly,</hi> 1694, cited to oblige a man to perform a Duty, 1689.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36252:32"/>
you cite his writings, not only to add words of your own; but to leave out ſuch of his, as are moſt material, and of the greateſt importance. You know very well, that it is an undeniable <hi>Maxim</hi> in <hi>Grammar,</hi> and a thing in it ſelf that cannot be otherwiſe, <hi>viz.

Were <hi>Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> this day living on Earth, might not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and others hear them diſcourſe about Vertue? Certainly you are not hence to infer (as the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers ſeem to imply) that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can joyn in Worſhip with men of every <hi>Sect,</hi> or Opinion in the World. God forbid he were of that Judgment. There is one thing here very remarkable; which is altogether omitted by the Libellers, to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s great diſadvantage; <hi>viz.</hi> He did not uſe the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned word <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> or in general terms; but with <hi>Qualification,</hi> adding in that ſame very line with the words cited; yet, ſays he, <hi>I could not do it at that juncture; for I was ſure it would give great offence to many on both ſides.</hi> This is an Infallible ſign, that tho' he be in many things not very ſcrupulous, yet he is cautious and loth to offend a weak Brother. In this point he is much of the opinion of that Famous and Learned perſon <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his <hi>Conviv. Relig.

The whole Colloquie is well worth your reading, eſpicially a page or two that follow theſe words; which make much to the preſent purpoſe.

But the chief thing here, which ſtartles him, is, that he finds moſt part of the People, that have ſeen his Printed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and eſpecially (which is very ſtrange) the Miniſters of the Goſpel, do quite miſtake the meaning of the words, thinking by the <hi>Powers of the Nation,</hi> that he underſtands only the <hi>Civil Powers;</hi> whereas he means both <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> as the ſaid Paper expreſly bears; for there he mentions the then ſitting <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> which was made up of both the Powers; and he further adds, <hi>Or the enſuing Parliament,</hi> which alſo conſiſted (at leaſt for ſometime) of both. But indeed the Caſe alters, when they ſit ſeperate, as now; for he ſtill was, and yet is of the Judgment, that the Church has an <hi>Intrinſick</hi> power; tho' perhaps he will not grant it to be ſo ample and wide, as ſome would have it. But this being a <hi>Tickliſh</hi> Point, he will not meddle with it. And further, he finds that many do much miſtake him about what he means by the <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Policy</hi> or <hi>Governmeat of the Church.</hi> In ſhort, he thereby underſtands only ſuch Matters, Circumſtances, Rites, Ceremonies (call them as you pleaſe) without which the true Worſhip of God can't be rightly performed; and yet

                     <p>'Tis here to be conſidered, that there is a vaſt difference between telling a thing openly in a School before all the Boys, and to one or two in a corner, or apart by themſelves.

                     <p>To convince all the World of <hi>M. K.</hi>'s Innocency in this Point, he humbly offers theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Menſtrua</hi> is not to be found in his Grammar, which he has taught theſe 22 years by gone.

He can adduce hundreds, that have been his Scholars to atteſt that he paſſeth obſcene Words and Sentences occurring in Authors, not ſo much as glancing at them; much leſs exponing; and leaſt of all explaining them; though often curious Boys preſs hard to know them things: <hi>Nitimur in vetitum.</hi> He can inſtance ſome, that have cry'd out to their Comrades, <hi>Ipſe Preceptor neſcit; ideo non vult nobis interpretari:</hi> Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the laſt two Lines, 4 <hi>Od.</hi> 1 <hi>lib.

Yea, the Libellers themſelves do here acknowledge the thing; nor do they ſay, that he did it amiſs: they only ſeem to blame him, that he mentions before his Scholars, the Liberty ſome people take to ſport and play on that Day.

That he corrects them not with that Severity, that is due according to their Fault, and as he finds inprudence may tend to their good, is a moſt groſs Falſhood. His Accuſers may be aſham'd to charge him with this, as a Fault; for in the Year 1690, theſe ſame very Men did ſtage his predeceſſor, Mr. <hi>Geo.

Many Parents here and elſewhere, have much commended him for converſing familiarly, and playing with their Children: yea, have earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him ſo to do, Was it not by this Mean, that that Noble and Famous Youth, my Lord <hi>Bruce,</hi> in ſo ſhort a time attain'd the Knowledge, not only of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, but many other things? Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did perpetually converſe with him, play'd with him; lay in Bed with him: hence was ſtill teaching him. Which Method and Carriage, did wonderfully pleaſe the Earl his Father, a moſt knowing and learned Perſon. If you doubt of this, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can produce the Earl's Letters as an infallible Sign.

They know not that Boys are learning a Language, even, when they are playing. As to that inſtance they give about the Foot-ball; when you have conſider'd all Circumſtances, you can't but highly approve of what Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did in this Matter. Know therefore that the people of <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Tiviot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> are too too much addicted to that violent Sport; and the Youth follow their Example.

                        <q>There be various kinds of Lyes, Some people in a drolling man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, can coin you many hundreds, only to make ſport. Others out of an oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and bragging humour will not ſtand to tell with the greateſt confidence imaginable; a thouſand ſtories of things, they ſaw, or heard in forreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſome remote places, which yet they certainly know to be meer fictions of their own brains. No doubt, but both theſe ſorts of Lyes are very diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Gods ſight, And yet there is no Malice, nor evil deſign in the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Ay, but there is a third ſort, which is a moſt horrid and wicked kind of Lying; <hi>viz.</hi> When men induſtriouſly hatch and contrive means and methods to calumniate and diſgrace their Neighbour. This Indeed we may juſtly call a moſt Malicious and Helliſh kind of Lying; Malice, as it were, ſitting at its very root, cauſing it to ſprout and bud, and come to perfection. There is alſo variety of this malicious kind of Lying. Some Calumnies are made up of pure Lyes: <hi>a Series,</hi> or <hi>Concatenation</hi> of meer Forgeries. Such was that you heard about the Woman in <hi>Blakader, Sect.</hi> 23. <hi>Part</hi> 2. where you have four wrapp'd up in one Bundle, without any mixture of Truth. This, we confeſs, is a rare kind of Lying; much like pure <hi>Jambick</hi> Verſes, ſeldom read in any Author. The more common way therefore is to mix your Lyes here and there with ſome <hi>Specious</hi> Truths, which will be like a ſweet Vehicle to carry down the bitter and poyſonous Pill. Now know, that both theſe kinds of lying are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Wicked and Malicious in themſelves; yet this is by far more dangerous, than the other; becauſe 'tis liker to prevail with people, and therefore in ſome reſpect may be call'd a more grievous ſin, than the other. To it you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a very cunning and ſubtil way of Calumniating, <hi>viz.</hi> When words or <hi>Phraſes</hi> are ſo artificially contrived, that he, who hears them, cannot but have a very bad impreſſion of the Perſon underſtood by them; yet they are capable of another ſenſe. So that if you challenge the Author, he'll tell you, he mean'd ſo and ſo. <hi>(B)</hi> who would not hence infer that Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Family does not attend the Ordinances; at leaſt are very neglective of that duty; and that the fault lies in him.</q>

Pray who elſe in the World, but themſelves, would have ſo underſtood theſe words? Did we not tell you in the former <hi>Remark,</hi> that they always have ſome little back-door to creep out at.

Yea, it rather augments, than leſſens the Calumny; and does highly demonſtrate, how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious the Libellers are. 'Tis as abſurd, as if you ſhould point with your finger at 7 or 8 Perſons, ſaying, <hi>Lo, there's a Company of moſt wicked and lewd Fellows; Whoremongers and Adulterers.</hi> And when you are Challenged for that Expreſſion, to ſay, <hi>You only mean one of them is ſuch, which you can Inſtruct.</hi> 'Tis not very proper, we confeſs, for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to proclaim his Wives praiſes; and therefore all he ſhall ſay here, is, that he leaves to any perſon, that ever had the occaſion to converſe with her; yea, even to thoſe, that have lived ſome years in her Family, Servants or others, to declare, what unchriſtian behaviour, or unbecoming and unjuſt deed they at any time ſaw in her. Yet, ſince ſhe is here accuſed, tho indirectly, of a very heynous Crime; and he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her account, it ſeems neceſſary he ſay ſomething both for his own, and her vindication. Her Crime is, <hi>That ſhe attends not the Ordinances of God in the Church-Aſſemblies:</hi> His is, <hi>That he obligeth her not to perform that duty.</hi> Now know that there was not a Woman in <hi>Kelſo</hi> more obſervant of good order, than ſhe, till Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Elders had Calumniated her Husband, eſpecially with the buſineſs in <hi>Blakader.</hi> After that indeed ſhe had no heart to hear him preach; and the better he Preached, ſhe thought him the worſe Man. It was ſore againſt her Husband's will, that ſhe deſerted the publick place of Worſhip; and therefore he not only was a good example by keeping it himſelf (to the admiration of many hundreds of People) but exhorted her ſo to do. Two Lords-days in complyance with his earneſt deſire, ſhe went to the Church ſore againſt her inclination. On the third, ſhe did go alſo in the Fore-noon; but after ſhe was returned, ſhe told her Husband with tears, that ſhe could not hear that man any longer; nor any other, that approved his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: She told, ſhe got no good from his Preaching; ſhe heard him with a wonderful Reluctancy of Spirit, and therefore ſhe earneſtly begg'd no more to force her to go to the Church. <hi>I'll go,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to the Meeting-Houſe, where I hope to reap more good.</hi> Her Husband being fully perſuaded, that ſhe ſpoke ſincerely, ceaſed to preſs her further. Now think you not but Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> ought to have ſpoken privately to Mrs. <hi>Kirkwood,</hi> before he brought this buſineſs into the Synod? Who knows, but he might have reclaim'd her from her Error? Whereas by this his carriage, ſhe is the more hardned in it; yea, he never once ſpake to her in his life, nor was in her Houſe, tho ſhe be his door Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

He never ſaw one Cup of his drink, nor a Crumb of his Bread in all the ſaid ſix Viſits. In a word, Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> never once open'd his mouth to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (except at the ſaid ſix Viſits, and with difficulty then) from his firſt Entry, 24 <hi>Jan.</hi> 95, to the 12 of <hi>March</hi> thereafter, when ſitting in Judgment with his 5 Elders in a Surprize he ſtruck him through the very heart with a <hi>(E) Thunderbolt</hi> from Heaven, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hell, <hi>viz.</hi> that horrid Calumny about the Woman in <hi>Blakader.</hi> 3. He me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> ſays the Libel. O dreadful Calumny! What kind of Menacing can this be? 4. He uſeth falſe Suggeſtions, and Informations to others againſt him. This Mr. <hi>K.</hi> flatly denies. He gives a true account of his buſineſs, for his own Vindication and Information. 5. He unjuſtly detains his Brew-Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Denies it belongs to Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> but to the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> of which you have a large account in the <hi>Remark (C.)</hi>

                        <q>This 15th Article, as are many of the reſt, is made up of ſeveral different Points: So that in effect, theſe 15 Articles may be extended to 3 or 4 times as many. <hi>(B)</hi> This Point of Menacing Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> did ſtartle Mr. <hi>K.</hi> more than any other in the whole Libel. He could not Dream, <hi>when, where,</hi> nor <hi>how</hi> he had ever Menac'd him. The word you know, in it ſelf has a very bad aſpect; but the many ſtrange Circumſtances of the Perſons and matter in hand make it look infinitely more ugly. Any body would imagine that it imply's ſome very ill natur'd and wicked thing; which truly made Mr. <hi>K.</hi> quake and tremble, when he firſt read it. And therefore you may beſure, he was very glad when he heard Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> give his Commentary on it; <hi>viz.</hi> that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>If you alter the antient Conſtitution and Cuſtom of this place, by debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from the Offices under debate, and from the Profits thereto belonging; and conſequently make null the Contract made by the Earl and others with me, it may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a Rapture amongſt us, and give ground to a Law-Plea.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> calls Menacing, or Threatning; but, pray, who of ten Thoſand would have put ſo mild a Gloſs upon theſe words? We told you above, that there are ſome people, who can ſpeak ſo, that none knows their meaning, but themſelves. Suppoſe Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſpoke theſe words to Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> or to that purpoſe; they look rather like a good and wholſom advice given to Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> than a threatning; for Mr. K. ſaw further into the matter, than Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> could do; becauſe he knew the minds of the Principle Heretors, and others concerned; and more eſpecially, what he himſelf was to do in the affair, being the Perſon chiefly concerned of any whoſoever. <hi>(C)</hi> This buſineſs about the Brew-Houſe being a conſiderable part of the Proceſs, muſt not be paſs'd in a word or two; and therefore we ſhall firſt give you the following <hi>Remark,</hi> and thereafter an account of the Affair by it ſelf. <hi>(D)</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> as you will hear <hi>Sect.</hi> 32, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Libel againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> for this unchriſtian-like Expreſſion, as he would have it to appear. Know therefore, that all Mr. <hi>K.</hi> thereby underſtands, is, that he was mightily ſurprized, and almoſt ſtruck dead with that horrid buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Blakader:</hi> and therefore he compared it to a <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> from Heaven, on the account of its ſuddenneſs and force, as a thing deſcending from on high upon him in a Surpriſe; and immediately, as it were, he corrects himſelf; <hi>Or rather,</hi> ſays he, <hi>from Hell,</hi> in regard of the Malicious Contrivance, or Helliſh deſign they had, who did firſt hatch it.</q>

                     <head>An Account of the Buſineſs about the <hi>Brew-Houſe,</hi> or Controverted <hi>Vault.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>This being one of the grand Points of the Plea, and the occaſion of no little Clamour and Talk every where; tis very proper ſome account be given of it in this place; for it comes not ſo well in any where elſe. Be pleaſed therefore to know theſe following particulars, which we ſhall but name.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Earls of <hi>Roxburgh</hi> are Proprietors of the Abbacy of <hi>Kelſo;</hi> and hence it is, that a great many Perſons of the moſt eminent dignity in this Kingdom hold Lands of them; particularly the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Hamilton, Earls</hi> of <hi>Home, Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Lawderdale,</hi> &amp;c. 2. 'Tis now, and has been paſt memory, almoſt quite ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there only remaining 10 or 12 old Vaults, and a Church, memorable, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for what it ſeems to have been, than for what it is. 3. The Earls have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a part of theſe Vaults, by granting Charters thereon, and giving Liberty to theſe their Vaſſals, to Alter, Repair, and Build them <hi>De Novo</hi> for their greater Conveniency. 4. Some of theſe Vaults once were all that the Miniſters of <hi>Kelſo</hi> had for their <hi>Manſe,</hi> or Dwelling houſe; particularly Mr. <hi>Ja. Xnox,</hi> who died 1633; for people of old were not ſo nice in their Houſes, Clothing, and Dier. as in our days. The Vault now under debate, was his Hall, and Kitchen, and another of it his Bed-Chamber and Cloſet, tho' both much below ground. His
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36252:37"/>
Son Mr. <hi>Robert</hi> ſucceeding, got built him for his better accommodation, two little <hi>To-falls,</hi> as they call them, or <hi>Galleries,</hi> the one to walk and ſtudy in; the other was his Bed-Chamber. He died 1658. <hi>Doctor Weddal</hi> ſucceeding, things were repair'd much to the better. After him came <hi>Doctor Lorimer,</hi> in whoſe time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a good Addition was made; and yet it was ſtill imperfect. Next was ſettled Mr, <hi>Ja. Gray;</hi> who being a ſingle Perſon tabl'd himſelf in the Town, ſo that it ſtanding empty all his time, and 3 or 4 years thereafter during the vacancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came little better than ruinous. And therefore in the Year 1694 it was taken down almoſt to the foundation, and a very fine Manſe Re-built, tho' then none knew, who was the man that ſhould inhabit it. 5. Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> poſſeſſeth 5 Vaults beſides this new Building, all which could not be done in <hi>Kelſo</hi> for the double of what the Law requires. 6. The School-Maſters of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> till Mr. <hi>K.</hi> came, liv'd in a very pitiful hole, rather than a houſe; and therefore for his greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, they have Built a very good Houſe. When this was a contriving, a Propoſal was made by one concern'd, that to Repair the Vault under debate (which was then altogether ruinous) would ſave at leaſt 5 or 600 Marks; and this Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was to do on his own expences or give 200 Marks to the Wright and Maſon: to which he willingly condeſcended, they obliging themſelves to build a Cloſet on the top of his Turnpick. Yet this buſineſs with what he has done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in his Houſe, has coſt him above 300 Marks. He will not name here what his Plea about the Vault has ſtood him: this he leaves to you to gueſs what it may amount to. From theſe Premiſes any perſon, you would think, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe will infer, that ſuppoſe the <hi>Earl</hi> had cauſed to build a Manſe every way ſufficient in it ſelf, and in a place abundantly convenient, Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> had no reaſon to complain, nor to claim right to theſe old Vaults on the Account, that once they were poſſeſſed by his Predeceſſors, as you ſee expreſly contained in the Libel; but on the contrary ought rather to thank the Earl for a better Houſe to live in. And further, you ſee that this complaint in a matter Civil made by the Elders, who are not the Perſons Concern'd, is given into a Church Judicature; as if forſooth they could be Judges of mens Rights and Properties; and which is yet more Remarkable, where Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> who ought to be complainer, and ſtand at Bar with Mr. K. ſits his Judge. A fit Judge indeed! Both Judge and Party. But if you had ſeen, what odd work the Earls Commiſſioners and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had one day before a Committee to get him removed from being Judge in this and other points; and had heard what he ſaid, when he came off the Bench; you would think another thing. The next ſtep Mr. <hi>K.</hi> made, after Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> was removed, was to diſtinguiſh the matters of his Proceſs into <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and Civil, as you will hear within a little in the Reaſons of <hi>Appeal</hi> from this Committee, <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. Hence it was, that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> cauſed to Summons Mr. <hi>K.</hi> before the Sheriff of <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> where the buſineſs about the Vault was debated <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> pretty warmly by Proctours on both ſides. At laſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> finding the Earls Right like to be encroached upon, uſed means to carry the Cauſe before the Lords of Seſſion, who alone are the Proper Judges in matters of this kind. And therefore by a <hi>Bill</hi> given into their Lordſhips, he firſt obtain'd a <hi>Siſt;</hi> and thereafter an <hi>Advocation,</hi> which buſineſs ſtood him two or three <hi>Expreſſes</hi> into <hi>Edenb.</hi> beſides other Expences there. After ſome little debate at <hi>Edenb.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> gets it again remitted back to the Sheriff; and alſo obtains a Sentence for 15 Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> of <hi>Remit</hi>-Money.</p>
                     <p>Now begins hot work. It would be very tedious to give you a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of matters. We ſhall only touch one thing, which gave occaſion of much Talk and Clamour through the whole Country; and, they ſay, made good ſport be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court at <hi>Jedburgh.</hi> Know therefore that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> fail'd not to cite abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36252:37"/>
of Witneſſes; but many of them were not competent. The point admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be prov'd, was, that the ſaid Vault was in uſe, to be poſſeſs'd by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters at <hi>Kelſo.</hi> The firſt day appear'd only three; of which one was rejected, becauſe a Party, being one of the Libellers: annother was caſt as a Perſon once convicted of Theft: the third depon'd in Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi>'s favour; but being a ſingle Witneſs did not the Jobb. Another day he Summon'd a vaſt number; a good part went from <hi>Kelſo</hi> to <hi>Jedburgh</hi> (6 or 7 Miles) in a mighty great Storm; poor people wading ſome on foot, ſome on Horſes through great wreaths of Snow. But the ſport was, that Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and his Lawyers either through Negligence or Ignorance, had omitted to perform a neceſſary point of Law; ſo that all theſe Witneſſes return'd home, as they went away, without deponing. Great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty had the old poor people to wreſtle home, two upon a Horſe, except where they had the <hi>Cadaver</hi> to drag out from amongſt the Snow, ſome of them curſing Mr. <hi>Jaq.</hi> and wiſhing he were buried in the ſaid Vault. On the third day, Mr. <hi>Jaq.</hi> gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d his point by getting it prov'd, that the ſaid Vault was in uſe to be poſſeſs'd by the Miniſters of <hi>Kelſo.</hi> Know alſo, that an Interloquitor paſs'd in Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, giving him power to adduce a conjunct Probation; whereby he made good theſe following points. 1. That the preſent Manſe is far better than any that ever was in <hi>Kelſo;</hi> and much beyond what the Law requires. 2. That the Earls of <hi>Roxb.</hi> have actually diſpoſed of theſe Vaults, even of ſome that have been poſſeſs'd by the Miniſters of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> by giving Charters thereupon, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. 3. That the Vault under debate, was altogether ruinous and unhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and had been ſo for many years; and that it was repair'd at Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and that he poſſeſs'd it by the Earl's Order. 4. That other School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters before him, made uſe of it by brewing therein. And thus after the buſineſs had been debated many days, there was a kind of a Ceſſation of Arms for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Weeks, the Sheriff delaying for reaſons known to himſelf to give out Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, both Parties, you may be ſure, gaping for't. At laſt, there fell out a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingular Paſſage, the moſt ſtrange by far of any in this <hi>Plea,</hi> except the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> that one of the Miniſters made to Hell, above hinted at, but to be given a more full account of within a little. The odd paſſage here mention'd, is a ſhort Dialogue between Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> in the Church in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on the <hi>Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s Day;</hi> of which <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Part.</hi> 5. For this and ſome other things, as you will hear <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was cited at <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s inſtance with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of His Majeſty's Advocate before the Lords of Privy-Council; and alſo his Proctor with about 40 or 50 other Perſons, as witneſſes to their great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expence at <hi>Edenb.</hi> and loſs at home, it being in <hi>March,</hi> the buſieſt time of labouring; and ſome of them being very poor People, their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were near to ſtarving at home, 12 or 14 days.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Mr. K.</hi> is attending at <hi>Edenb.</hi> a Decreet paſſes againſt him before the Sheriff in <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> ordaining him to remove from the Vault. There paſs'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Alternative Sentence, obliging him to ſatisfie <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi>'s damage in lying out of the Vault, unleſs he could prove he poſſeſs'd it <hi>bona fide, viz.</hi> by the Earl's Order; which was to be inſtructed by producing a Paper under one of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator's hands, expreſly bearing, that he did poſſeſs it by his Lordſhip's Order: which accordingly was done under the hand of Sir <hi>W. Ker</hi> of <hi>Greenhead. Mr. Jaq.</hi> was not ſlow, as ſoon as he got his Decreet extracted, to give <hi>Mr. K.</hi> a Charge, inſtantly to remove. He gave him alſo a Charge of Horning for payment of the abovementioned Sum of 15<hi>l. Scots,</hi> of Remit-Money. The <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> being then in <hi>Tiviotdale, Mr. K.</hi> acquaints their Honours with the whole buſineſs. Immediately they take the <hi>Plea</hi> into their own hands, and ſuſpend both the Decreet of removing, and the Sentence about the Remit-mony. And thus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36252:38"/>
matters ſtood, 25th of <hi>May,</hi> 1697; on which day, Intimation was made to <hi>Mr. Jaque</hi> of the ſaid Affair. Now to conclude, know, that, notwithſtanding the <hi>Miniſter</hi>'s Manſe in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> be every way ſufficient, and more than double (as to Expence) what the Law of this Nation requires; yet 'tis offer'd by the <hi>Earl</hi> and others, that, what may be found wanting therein after a Viſitation, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd. Hence you clearly ſee, how unjuſt they are, that would blame the <hi>Earl</hi> in this Affair, who deſigns nothing, but to defend his own Right and Property: and yet, you ſee, is ready to do Juſtice in the matter to thoſe, who pretend they are injur'd.</p>

                     <head>A Special Remark on this Point of the Libel.</head>
                     <p>People that do not underſtand the true State of things, are made believe that this buſineſs about the Vault was the occaſion of the whole Plea. This were to make the Effect exceed the Cauſe; a thing as abſurd, as if you ſhould ſay, <hi>That the Son was born many years before the Father had a Being:</hi> This <hi>Plea</hi> began 18 or 20 months, before there was any thing about the Vault. We now go on: To tell you, that after the Libel and Defences were read, as above-related, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> receiv'd a Liſt of one and thirty Witneſſes, of which only two were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd; and the Libellers were appointed to anſwer the Defences on the 24th, then inſtant; and he to object againſt the Witneſſes the ſaid Day. Laſtly, know that this day <hi>Geo. Pringle,</hi> Bailyff in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> gave into the Committee a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſubſcribed by the Earl, granting him power to appear before the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, or any other Church Judicatures, as above ſpecified in the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Mr. Ker</hi> and <hi>Mr. Potts;</hi> which Commiſſion of the Baily ordered him to require, that the Libellers ſhould give their Oaths of Calumny.

                     <hi>SEptemb.</hi> 24, 1695. This is the <hi>Grand Day</hi> of Action, mention'd once and again in the preceding Part of this Work; and is frequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the following. A day, that juſtly deſerves to be kept in perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance on the account of the many ſtrange things done, and acted therein by the moſt wonderful and monſtrous kind of Judicature, that ever was on the face of the Earth ſince the Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was never ſo ſtraightned and perplex'd with any thing in his Life, as he is, how to give an Account of this days work. 'Tis a thing, which muſt be done, otherwiſe he can't but ſuffer extreamly: And yet he trembles to venture on't; ſuch a vaſt number of things ſcare him from attempting it; ſo that after he had taken Pen once and again, he threw it by him, being fully reſolv'd to touch it no more. 1. Such a vaſt number of ſtrange and various Things occur; and theſe with little or no dependency one upon another, that he knows not where to begin, nor how to go on. 2. Many things, which properly belong to this place, are ſpoke to elſewhere, and that in ſuch Papers, as can't be well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, particularly in the Reaſons of Appeals; but eſpecially in that famous Paper given in to the Synod at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> of which <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, <hi>Part.</hi> 4. So that 'tis impoſſible to evite <hi>Tautologies.</hi> There's a neceſſity to ſpeak of them here; and 'tis hard to get by them there. 3. 'Tis not poſſible he can give you an exact account of Matters; becauſe his Judges do flatly refuſe him the Extracts of Papers, which in Law and Reaſon he ought to have; particularly the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Witneſſes, which with ſome others would give great light to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account. 4. He can't here ſhun ſome unſavory Words and Expreſſions, unleſs he ſhould omit lawful Means for his own Vindication. 5. He will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, not only to ſpeak of, but to name ſome Perſons ſore againſt his Will, both on their own and their Relations accunt. But he hopes all good Men will
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36252:38"/>
pardon him to uſe lawful means to vindicate his good Name, from the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of wicked Men. Now that this ſo neceſſary a part of the Proceſs (being the very Foundation, whereon all that follows is built) may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we ſhall uſe all means poſſible we can to ſet things ſo lively before your Eyes, that, unleſs you wilfully hood-wink your ſelf, it ſhall not be in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to paſs them undiſcern'd. We ſhall therefore firſt, give you a ſhort Touch of the Judges; both as to their <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Qualities:</hi> In the next place, we ſhall ſpeak of the Matter, or Subject of their Conſideration; and the way or manner of their Procedure.</p>

                     <head>About the Number of the Judges.</head>
                     <p>Of all the abovemention'd Aſſiſtants, none were preſent, except Mr. <hi>Couden,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Duns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the Members of the Presbytery, being only ſeven, four were Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gaudy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tomſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simſon;</hi> and conſequently ought not to ſit Judges. Mr. <hi>Boid,</hi> their Moderator, went home, after Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd from them to the Synod; and ſo was neither preſent that Afternoon, nor the day following, for they ſat two days. Mr. <hi>Dalglieſh</hi> was at <hi>Edenb.</hi> as he himſelf ſaid to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> in <hi>Jedburgh</hi> Church-yard (22 <hi>Apr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> 96,) being call'd from the Synod on purpoſe to tell 3 or 4 Gentlemen ſtanding there with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was preſent or not. Hence you ſee, there only remains Mr. <hi>Glen</hi> in <hi>Stitchel,</hi> to join with Mr. <hi>Couden,</hi> to make up this Judicature; the one to ſit Moderator, the other Clerk. Was there ever, think you, ſuch another Court on Earth? Here is a King, and his Secretary; but not a Subject to be govern'd. And tho' there were a third Member, 'tis yet a very lame Judicature; for a Vote can't go about, but only even out and in. Now ſeems it not palpably evident, thot there was a deſign in not conſtituting a <hi>Quorum;</hi> at leaſt in refuſing to tell Mr. <hi>K.</hi> what number made one, when he crav'd to know it by way of Inſtrument. We know very well that ſome will tell you, that things here are exceedingly miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; for they wanted not Members beſides theſe, both to be Moderator and Clerk. We confeſs indeed, they had, and plac'd them too: Mr. <hi>Gaudy</hi> was their Moderator, and Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> Clerk: Yea, and Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> alſo ſat Judge, forſooth; and Mr. <hi>Simſon</hi> alſo, tho' all four Witneſſes in Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Liſt. Now know, that this Remedy is far worſe than the Diſeaſe. Pray, had they none to officiate, as Moderator and Clerk, but ſome of the Witneſſes? Fie, fie, the like was never practis'd in any Age before this. Saw you ever any Man ſit Clerk, and both call and anſwer to his own name with one breath? Here's one that can do more: officiate as Clerk, Witneſs, and Judge; yea, and be a Party to boot, and all at one minute. Give me one ſingle Parallel in the whole World, and you ſhall carry the Prize. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has enquir'd at ſome very knowing and learned Clerks, whether or not they ever heard or knew the like? <hi>Never, never,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>was ſuch a thing on earth.</hi>

                     <head>About the Qualities of the Judges.</head>
                     <p>This is infinitely more difficult, and far more dangerous a Task, than the former. 'Tis an eaſie thing to number the Perſons of Men; but to tell; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> 'tis not ſo. <hi>As to Mr.</hi> Couden, Far be it from Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to ſay or think, that he's an ill Man: Yet he muſt be pardon'd, if he poſitively aver that in this preſent buſineſs he has done many very unwarrantable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Acts. But theſe he attributes not to any ill nature in Mr. <hi>Couden,</hi> but to his Simplicity, and (if he dare ſay it) ignorance in matters of common Law and true Juſtice, and to a little <hi>Byaſs,</hi> which he has inſenſibly contracted from the very buſineſs under debate; And laſtly, and we may ſay chiefly, to the bad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion he has had of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> who was altogether a ſtranger to him. We ſay,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36252:39"/>
and do humbly conceive, that there is juſt ground to think, that the illegal and unjuſt Acts, done by Mr. <hi>Couden,</hi> have mainly flow'd from the bad Character ſome Perſons have given him of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> And who, pray, mere ready than his Brother, Mr. <hi>Jaque?</hi> For 'twas in this very Month, that he wrote that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned malicious Letter to a Gentleman in <hi>Edenb.</hi> a ſtranger, one he had not ſeen ſince the fiftieth Year of God, and then but a Boy at his School in <hi>Forreſs,</hi> about 8 Miles beyond <hi>Elgin</hi> of <hi>Murray.</hi> Now, ſince Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> gave to a ſtranger at ſuch a diſtance, and that by a Letter, written and ſubſcribed with his own hand, ſo black a Character of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſaying, that he was a Perſon <hi>deſtitute of Grace, deſtitute of Mother-wit;</hi> a Man of corrupt Principles, corrupt Morals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Since way ſay, he wrote ſo of him to one at a diſtance, what would he not ſay to his Brother-Miniſter, ſitting by him in his own Houſe; eſpecially, when this Brother was going about to prepare ground for a Sentence againſt ſo vile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable a Wretch, as Mr. <hi>J.</hi> repreſents Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to be: For, as you will hear, he calls him in another paper, <hi>The Devil's Agent, Factor for Hell.</hi> Mr. <hi>Couden's Byaſs.</hi> Know, that he was the Chief, or rather the only Perſon that brought Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> having ſtrongly recommended him to the Synod, <hi>Octob.</hi> 94, ſaying, that he was a great Preacher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And concluded with this; that he knew Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> would accept of a Call: by which recommendation Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi>'s name was put into the Liſt with Mr. <hi>Guttries</hi> and others, as is above-related, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Part</hi> 2. But Mr. <hi>Guttry</hi> carried it by Vote of Synod. Mr. <hi>Jaque</hi> and Mr. <hi>Couden</hi>'s acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was made in <hi>Ireland;</hi> For very few, if any, in <hi>Mers</hi> or <hi>Tiviotdale</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, he having been out of tho Kingdom from the Year 52, till after the late Revolution. Hence you clearly ſee Mr. <hi>Couden</hi>'s Byaſs, <hi>viz.</hi> His own Credit lies at ſtake: he having ſpoken ſo much in face of Synod to <hi>Mr.</hi> Jaque's praiſe, can't, but do all that lies in his power for him, both to ſave his own Reputation: and on the account of his old and intimate Acquaintance: and if he be thus obliged to do for <hi>Mr.</hi> Jaque, it follows of neceſſity, that he muſt oppoſe <hi>Mr. K. Mr.</hi> Jaque's Adverſary. To conclude this point; if you ſhall add all theſe three into one: 1. The black and dreadful Charactes, which <hi>Mr.</hi> J. puts on <hi>Mr. K.</hi> 2. That <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was altogether a ſtranger to <hi>Mr. Couden.</hi> 3. The <hi>Byaſs</hi> abovemention'd. If you unite, we ſay all three into one; it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſuppoſed, but they had ſuch influence upon <hi>Mr. Couden,</hi> as made him do things, which otherwiſe he would not have done. But whether theſe things had influence upon him or not, we are not here to debate, it not being the point in hand; our buſineſs is to ſhew you, that <hi>Mr. Couden</hi> did very many moſt unjuſt and illegal Acts. Yea, ſome things he did of ſo dreadful and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Aſpect, that you cannot hear of them without horror and amazement; of which buſineſs in its place. As to the Qualities of the Members of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, we need ſay little here; it being ſufficiently demonſtrated in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Paper given into the Synod at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> 21 <hi>Apr.</hi> 96, that they can neither be Judges nor Witneſſes, in this Proceſs, in regard they are Parties; Perſons very much concern'd, being exceedingly byaſſed, both as to Credit and Intereſt, as the ſaid Paper at more length bears, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. <hi>Part.</hi> 4. And therefore it was, that the ſaid Synod, and three ſince, lay'd them wholly aſide, as Parties. Yet we can't here well paſs without giving you a touch of two or three of them, who ſeem more active and diligent in the Affair than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of Mr.</hi> Glen. This Brother has openly ſhew'd himſelf once and again in face of a Judicature, an Adverſary to <hi>Mr. K.</hi> acting as Proctour for the other Party; and that when he was no member. And if he, and <hi>Mr Thomſon,</hi> Judge, Clerk, and Witneſs all at once, have in <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s preſence ſhew'd ſo much oppoſition, we leave to their own Conſciences, whether or not, they miſpreſented him in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36252:39"/>
ſecret to the Members of the Commiſſion of the <hi>G. A.</hi> at <hi>Edenb.</hi> That he was miſ-repreſented, is certain; by whom God knows. Theſe two, eſpecially <hi>Mr. Glen,</hi> waited punctually on at that time; and he thinks, he has juſt ground to be jealous of them. The manner how he was miſ-repreſented is given account of of in that frequently mention'd Paper given into the Synod at <hi>Jedburgh</hi> near the End. Yea, Mr. <hi>Glen</hi>'s prejudice and malice againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has run to ſuch a hight, that being in Company with ſome very worthy Gentlemen; and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> he ſaid, <hi>He deſerv'd to be hang'd.</hi> One of the Gentlemen reply'd, Mr. <hi>Glen: You are too free of your Hanging.</hi> And yet this man; this man alone, ſhall repreſent a whole Presbytery, by ſitting Judge (we may ſay) on the Life and Death, Fortune and Reputation; Falling and Standing of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his Poſterity for ever.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Jaque.</hi> It may juſtly amaze all the World, to think, that that man, who has ſpew'd out by Word and Writ ſo much ſpite and venom againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſhould yet be adduc'd as a Witneſs againſt him. And that, which makes it a Wonder of wonders, is, that at the ſame very minute he is ſitting his Judge alſo: Yea, a Party, a Member of the Seſſion; the Chief Member, a Former, Dictator, and Contriver of the Libels, which was referr'd to his Oath, as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> then taken at more length bear. We leave to any indifferent Perſon to judge, what Equity and Juſtice could be expected from a Judicature made up of ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and byaſſed Judges; there not being ſo much as one ſingle Perſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he had not juſt Exceptions. So much for the <hi>Number</hi> and Qualities of the Judges: follows the <hi>Subject</hi> of their Conſideration, and the <hi>Manner</hi> of their Procedure.</p>

                     <head>The Subject of their Conſideration.</head>
                     <p>We ſhall endeavour here to be as brief as poſſible we can, referring you in moſt things to other Papers, particularly to the Reaſons of Appeal ſubjoin'd to this days Action, <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. The things here ſpoken of are chiefly ſuch, as have come to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s knowledge, ſince he gave in theſe Reaſons; or, of which there is no account given elſewhere. Know then, that immediately after he was call'd in before the Committee, there was read a very pretty <hi>Trialogue,</hi> which with the frequent <hi>Remora</hi>'s or Stops by Laughter, took up a large time. The <hi>Trialogue</hi> was the above-written Libel and Defences, or Anſwers, and <hi>Remarks</hi> on the ſaid Defences; not theſe, which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has now ſubjoin'd for clearing of things; but <hi>Remarks,</hi> compos'd, as they ſay, by Mr. <hi>Jaque,</hi> and given in this day to the Committee by the Libellers, as they ſtile themſelves. All things indeed were done in very good Order. Firſt, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> read his <hi>Preface,</hi> or Preliminary Diſcourſe above ſet down: Next Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> Witneſs, Clerk, and judge above-nam'd, the firſt Article of the Libel: Then Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Defence: After him, <hi>Mich. Fiſher,</hi> Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-Clerk, the <hi>Remarks</hi> on the ſaid Defence. Laſtly, follow'd very prettily that, which Muſicians call, <hi>The Burden of the Song,</hi> a thing not unlike to <hi>Lil-li Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lero, Bullen-a-la. Lero, lero, lero; lero; Lil-li Bur-lero, Bullen-a-la.</hi> Or, if you pleaſe, call it, <hi>A Tighee;</hi> or, a very hearty Gaff of Laughter; eſpecially, when the ſaid <hi>Michael</hi> came to read and explain ſome <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi>-like words, ſuch as <hi>Nullifidianiſm;</hi> then indeed theſe, who ſung the <hi>Burden,</hi> prevented their time, and interrupted him in his Office: and there being a vaſt number of them, did quite ſink and over-power his Voice, In a word; 'twas a perfect <hi>Comedy,</hi> or rather a <hi>Stage-Play.</hi> Some were pleas'd to ſay, that they never ſaw better Sport in their life. And in truth it would ſeem, theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> thought ſhame of that days appearance; For they never ventur'd to ſet out their Heads to the view of the World thereafter; tho' Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has frequently by way of <hi>Inſtrument</hi> requir'd a ſight of them. He can inſtance ſome of the Judges, and theſe the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36252:40"/>
moſt intelligent amongſt them, who call'd them <hi>Silly ridiculous Things.</hi> You may be ſure, if they had come to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s hands, you ſhould have got a ſight of them with <hi>Minellius</hi>'s Notes at their Tail. And 'tis great injuſtice done him, that this and many other ſuch Papers are deny'd him. After the reading of this <hi>Trialogue,</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was order'd by the Committee to give an anſwer in Writing to the ſaid <hi>Remarks</hi> againſt eight a Clock next Morning (it being then between three and four in the Afternoon) and alſo to have his Objections againſt the Witneſſes in readineſs peremptorily at the ſaid hour. He complain'd of the ſhortneſs of the time, telling them, that theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> were ſo exceeding long, that he could not in that ſpace get them Copied over; Far leſs Anſwers given thereto, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, conſidering that he was over-wak'd ſome nights before. And as to that other Task, <hi>viz.</hi> to have his Objections ready againſt the Witneſſes, he ſaid it was impoſſible to do it; for he knew not who they were, the Liſt which they had given him conſiſting of bare Names, without any Deſignation: So that he knew neither who, nor what they were, nor where they liv'd, and therefore he could make no Objection againſt them. In ſhort; the Committee poſitively refuſing to give any ſatisfaction to theſe moſt reaſonable and juſt deſires, he with thoſe commiſſionated by the Earl, conſidering the Conſtitution, Nature and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that Judicature, thought they had too juſt ground to appeal from them to the next enſuing Synod. And therefore did appeal from them in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terms, taking Inſtruments thereupon, and within 10 days, conform to the act of the <hi>G. A.</hi> gave in their Reaſons, which you ſhall ſee in their place.</p>

Nor were <hi>Neuters,</hi> or indifferent Perſons ſuffer'd to ſtay within the Church to hear or ſee what was done amongſt them (tho' Law requires that at ſuch times there be Patent-doors;) and yet many Witneſſes were permitted to hear their Fellows depone. In a word; all things were turn'd <hi>Topſie-Turvy;</hi> the very Nature and Order of matters quite inverted; theſe thruſt out, that ſhould ſtay in; and theſe kept in, that ought to be turn'd out. Tho' we can't give you a perfect account of things, yet we hope we ſhall be able to let you ſee a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Sample,</hi> whereby you may have more than a Conjecture of theſe things you ſee not; for you may be ſure all are of one Stamp.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then know, that after Mr. <hi>Boid,</hi> their <hi>Moderator,</hi> a very knowing Man, and of great Experience in matters of Diſcipline, had left them, all things went into <hi>Confuſion.</hi> They kept no Order, no Method, had no regard to the Articles and Words of the Libel, but run on <hi>ſuper Inquirendis;</hi> in general terms, any thing that Witneſſes had to ſay, or were pleas'd to tell concerning Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is reckon'd one of the Grievances of the former Reign, and repreſented to His Majeſty as ſuch, and given in by the Convention of States, 13 <hi>Apr.</hi> 89, with the <hi>Claim of Right.</hi> 2. The Witneſſes depon'd on <hi>Hear-ſay:</hi> Yea, <hi>double Hear-ſay;</hi> as <hi>Paul ſaid that John ſaid, he heard Peter ſay:</hi> and this without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting one with another; which thing the Synod found to be a fault, as ſhall be ſhew'd in its place in a Buſineſs about <hi>Beſſy Thomſon, Sect.</hi> 29, where you will ſee a very remarkable Paſſage, and a warm debate between <hi>Mr. Semple</hi> and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> By the way we muſt tell you, if Sir <hi>Jo. Pringle</hi> of <hi>Stitchel,</hi> had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this Meeting, as he was at the other two, when the ſaid <hi>Beſſy</hi> was call'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36252:40"/>
in, certainly things had not been carried on after that manner they were done. And if he had been advertis'd, he would have come, as he himſelf declar'd. And when he heard that Witneſſes were examined with cloſe doors (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of many other much groſſer Acts of Injuſtice) <hi>That one,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is enough to anul all they have done.</hi> It ſeems, the Brethren had no will that ſo knowing and juſt a Perſon, as Sir <hi>John</hi> is, ſhould ſit amongſt them, otherwiſe they would have given him advertiſement. And, ſince they did it not to him, who lives ſo near, even almoſt at Mr. <hi>Glen</hi>'s door, how much leſs, ſuppoſe you, would they do it to thoſe who live at a diſtance? 3. The Judge himſelf prompted and puſh'd on the <hi>poſterior Deponent</hi> to confeſs what might confirm the depoſition of the <hi>Prior;</hi> and that by plainly telling him what the <hi>Prior</hi> Witneſs had depon'd, on purpoſe certainly to make him depone the ſame. Lo the Equity and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of a Judge! Yea, much rather the hight of Iniquity, and downright <hi>Partiality.</hi> 4. Things depon'd, which made for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> were not recorded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either altogether omitted, or not ſubſcribed by the <hi>Deponent.</hi> 5. Witneſſes that had already depon'd, ſat at the Table with the Judges, and not only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd, but debated and diſputed with other Witneſſes, while deponing, bidding them do this and the other thing: particularly, Mr. <hi>Jo. Taylor,</hi> Brother-in-Law to Mr. <hi>Glen,</hi> did exceedingly marr Mr. <hi>Will. Knox,</hi> again and again, offering to diſpute the <hi>Matter</hi> with him; till at laſt, Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> told him, he ought not to ſit in that Place, far leſs ſpeak at the rate he did. 6. They not only took ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal methods to prove their falſe and calumnious Aſſertions; but made uſe of <hi>crooked, backward, ſiniſtrous,</hi> and <hi>ridiculous Means</hi> for that Effect, preferring <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi> to <hi>Demonſtrations;</hi> weak and fallible Arguments to certain and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truths; quite razing and deſtroying the fundamental Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, placing in their room new Fancies of their own Brain, as if thereby they could out-wit the very Wiſdom of the Nation. Laſtly, and which well might ſerve for all the reſt, being one of the moſt <hi>prodigious</hi> things, that ever was heard to proceed from the mouth of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much leſs from a Judge, and leaſt of all from a <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> and that ſiting in Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The thing is this: No kind of Pique; no ſort of Prejudice would have caſt you from being a Witneſs. Tho' you had ſaid to the Judge, you wiſh'd the greateſt of Evil (as to his Life) might befall <hi>Mr. K.</hi> you would have been ſuffer'd to depone. Suppoſe you had ſaid, you could ſee him <hi>hang'd, ſunk in the deep, ruin'd, diſgrac'd,</hi> &amp;c. yet you would have been ſuſtain'd as a Witneſs. This is not all we would ſay on this Head. The grand Point does yet remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worſe; yea, infinitely worſe than any thing you have yet heard: but we muſt beg your patience a little, and you ſhall have it in its proper place, <hi>Sect.</hi> 24.</p>

                  <p>This, they ſay, was ſuggeſted to J. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> by <hi>Mr. John Craig,</hi> his Brother-in-law, who was ſtanding at his Elbow. It did exceedingly amaze the whole Synod, and all that heard the ſame; and made them look one to another, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what might be the event of this matter. That, which amus'd moſt part, was <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi>'s Shyneſs to produce the Letter, which created great hopes in <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Enemies, and fear in his Friends; and the more ſhie and unwilling he was, ſo much the more forward and preſſing were the Libellers, and all that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd them. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſuſpecting the true Cauſe of <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi>'s unwillingneſs to produce the Letter, ſaid to the <hi>Moderator,</hi> that it was very like, there might be in that Letter a particular Buſineſs altogether extrinſick to the matter in hand, which <hi>Mr. Riddle,</hi> perhaps had no will ſhould be read in ſo publick a manner.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36252:41"/>
There is indeed in the laſt two Lines, reply'd <hi>Mr. Riddle,</hi> a Particular, no wiſe relating to this preſent Buſineſs, which I have no will ſhould be read ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. At which, J. <hi>Thomſon</hi> again cry's out, <hi>Moderator, I hope it is not Treaſon, and ſo may be read. There be many things beſides Treaſon,</hi> reply'd Baily <hi>Pringle,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner for the Earl, <hi>that are not fit to be proclaim'd through the Country. Would you be content, that every body knew your Count-Book?</hi> In ſhort, after no little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the Synod order'd <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi> to go home to his Chamber, and fetch the Letter. It being produc'd, they made him ſwear <hi>de novo,</hi> That theſe two Lines at the cloſe of the Letter contain'd nothing relating to the Buſineſs in hand. And alſo <hi>Mr. Orock,</hi> who got the Letter to read, promis'd on the Word of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> that he ſhould not read, nor diſcover the ſaid two Lines; (this is the half Oath abovemention'd) but yet a Brother, they ſay, ſtanding at <hi>Mr. Orock</hi>'s back, found out the Secret; a vrry harmleſs Buſineſs contained in two ſingle Letters, whereby was ſignify;d the name of a certain Perſon, to whom <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi> was to give <hi>Mr. Knox</hi>'s Service. As to the Queſtion under Debate, this Letter was ſo far from claſhing either with <hi>Mr. Knox,</hi> or <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi>'s Depoſition, that it ſtrengthn'd and confirm'd all they had ſaid; ſo that ſome Member of the Synod was pleas'd to ſay, <hi>We are all aſham'd.</hi> Whether the Synod had power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>Mr. Riddle</hi> to produce the Letter, let Stateſmen and Lawyers determine. This we dare aver, that ſome very knowing Perſons ſay, that they tranſgreſs'd their lines, and did what they ought not to have done; eſpecially conſidering, that the Controverſie was already determin'd by Oaths. And thus ended that Buſineſs, whereon the Libellers plighted their main Anchor. Hence we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude this point with that old ſaying of the Poet.</p>

                  <p>VVHat could give riſe to this ſo ſtrange a Paſſage, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can't imagine. He is ready to depone upon his great Salvation, that he is ſo far from having ſpoken, or debated with Mr. <hi>Riddle,</hi> or any other perſon in the World about that Subject, that never in his life any ſuch thought entred his mind. He was altogether an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in that matter, having never either heard or read of it. Now indeed, ſince this buſineſs fell out, ſome very learned Doctors of Phyſick have ſhewd him Books expreſly maintaining that there are ſix Senſes; and that that under debate is the ſixth; particularly, D. <hi>Jo. Archer,</hi> one of His Majeſty's Phyſicians in Ordinaay, <hi>p.</hi> 79.84, and 85. <hi>Edit.</hi> 2. printed at <hi>London, An.</hi> 1673. And <hi>Bontieoe</hi> in his <hi>Aecon.

What mov'd Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> to carry ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this whole Affair, 'tis hard to conjecture: Yet certainly, there's ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in't, which we can't reach; the Circumſtances are ſo very odd. About 7 or 8 days before he depon'd (having then got his Summons) he declar'd to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman and his Lady, with the greateſt Aſſe verations one can uſe, except before a Judge, that he had not nothing to ſay, which could any manner of way make againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> He repeated the ſame words again the very ſame day he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd, as he was dining with three Gentlemen. He has thereby hugely wrong'd himſelf many ways; and ſmarted for it ſince. He has exceedingly diſoblig'd his Relations Perſons of Honour and Reſpect: his own Father, whom Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had never ſeen before, was pleas'd to make Apology for his Son's Fault. And that, which chiefly adds to their Trouble, is, that he was not oblig'd, neither
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36252:42"/>
in Law, nor Conſcience to depone, doing it upon meer <hi>Hear-ſay;</hi> and that <hi>ſuper Inquirendis;</hi> it not being ſpecified in the Libel, as the Law requires. He wanted not Friends, Men of great Knowledge, to adviſe him; but he ſlighted them, and went, (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is certainly inform'd) and conſulted the Buſineſs with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Presbytery; particularly with Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> in <hi>Ecford.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>K.</hi> is very loth ſtill to be harping upon one ſtring, and always raking dung out of a filthy Puddle.

But here's the Miſery; After he has got out of one Puddle, they fling him into another; and after that into a third, and fourth. Ah; 'tis to be fear'd, if God ſend him not help, they will never deſiſt, till they end his days in ſome hole or other. Lo, here a moſt uggly and durty one, as is repreſented, tho' not ſo in it ſelf.

What Witneſs depon'd it: Whether only once, or frequently us'd in his School; Whether by Maſter, or Scholars, or both: Whether in his School at <hi>Lithgo, Edenburgh,</hi> or <hi>Kelſo,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can't give you no certain account; for amongſt many other great Acts of Injuſtice done him, this is one; that his Judges would never ſuffer him to ſee the <hi>Depoſitions;</hi> yea, not ſo much as to let him hear them read over. That this word is amongſt the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> is certain; for many of the Judges have told him, that it was there, and, if his memory fail him not, they ſaid it was depon'd by <hi>Ja.

                     </head>
                     <p>The true Story is as follows. One, now Mr. <hi>Dan. Cameron,</hi> Precentor in the <hi>Gray-Fryars</hi> Church at <hi>Edenb.</hi> came about the year 1684, to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> then School-maſter of <hi>Lithgo,</hi> earneſtly begging he would be pleas'd to teach him <hi>Latin. M. K.</hi> conſidering <hi>Daniel</hi>'s years, which he took to be about eight or nine and twenty, anſwer'd; if his Ingine was tolerably good; and if he would be diligent, and continue ſo, he might ſoon acquire that Language. I ſhall ſtudy day and night, reply'd <hi>Daniel,</hi> till I have it. In ſhort, he falls indeed very frankly to work; and among other helps, reads <hi>Vocables,</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> in one Column, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in another: where reading the Parts of Man's Body; <hi>Caput,</hi> the Head, <hi>Manus,</hi> the Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he comes down to <hi>Coles,</hi> which he finds rendred <hi>A man's Yard. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> quite miſtakes the word <hi>Yard,</hi> thinking <hi>Coles</hi> ſignified <hi>A ſtack-Yard,</hi> or a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> that ſame with <hi>Hortus:</hi> And therefore in preſence of the whole School he ſays to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Sir, <hi>May not</hi> Coles <hi>ſignifie as well a Womans Yard, as a Mans;</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les matris, <hi>as well as</hi> Patris? <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſmiling, turn'd himſelf about, as if he had been going to beat a Boy for ſome Fault. In the mean time one <hi>Neal Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> a Boy of 7 or 8 years of age, ſtanding hard by <hi>Daniel,</hi> puſheth him pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſmartly with his Shoulder, ſaying; <hi>Houtman, Hout! 'Tis a you hae,</hi> ſounding it after the vulgar <hi>Scots</hi>-way, <hi>Daniel</hi> miſtakes this alſo, thinking <hi>Coles</hi> ſignified <pb n="79" facs="tcp:36252:42"/>
not only a Man's Garden, or Stack-yard; but his whole Fortune or Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> All he had or poſſeſs'd. And therefore another Boy, a Gentleman's Son in <hi>Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> perceiving him ſtill to be in a miſtake, pointed with his hand towards <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Breeches, ſaying; <hi>Stupidiſſime Aſine,</hi> Coles <hi>ſignificat,</hi> your Keegrels; your <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grels, Daniel.</hi> Then indeed <hi>Daniel</hi> came to know, what <hi>Coles</hi> ſignified, more by the demonſtration of the Boy's hand, than otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>This is all that paſs'd in the School.

They either could not, or would not inſtruct him, being, as we are told, otherwiſe buſied; For they were all like to be-piſs themſelves with Laughter. Hence 'twas (whether by their Fault, or the Deponent's, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, gave it not its proper ſound, 'tis not worth our while to enquire into) that it came to be ſpell'd with a <hi>G,</hi> and not a <hi>K, Gigrels,</hi> not <hi>Kigrels;</hi> or rather, as ſome great Artiſts in Spelling, ſay, it ſhould be <hi>Keegrels.</hi> This Error whether, we ſay, of the Clerk, or his Brethren, or the Deponent, has been the occaſion of no little work in the following Judicatures, and of great Laughter in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, where frequently it became the main <hi>Subject</hi> of Diſcourſe; ſome ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>Gigrels,</hi> as we do <hi>G</hi> in <hi>Lego;</hi> others, as it were, <hi>Jigrels,</hi> as we do <hi>G</hi> in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis;</hi> a third perſon crying out, that often he had heard <hi>Wagrels;</hi> but <hi>Keegrels, Gigrels,</hi> or <hi>Jigrels,</hi> did he never hear before.

Mr. <hi>Couden's</hi> Tenet, or Principle in this matter, is, that what makes not againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> needs not be Recorded, or Subſcribed. This he openly declared in face of a Committee, when he oppoſed <hi>Andrew Robſon</hi> Gardner in the <hi>Floors</hi> his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what he had depon'd, relating to the Woman that was ſaid to be with Child.

But much more is this, to be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Brethren, who ſat all the while their fellow Witneſſes depon'd.

                  <p>NExt depones <hi>James Broun,</hi> only Son to the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> a Boy or Youth, about 16 years of age. As he was going to depone, his Father ſays to <hi>Mr. Couden,</hi> Sir, <hi>my Son cannot be a Witneſs againſt Mr.</hi> K. <hi>in regard he has a prejudice at him; Mr.</hi> K. <hi>having beat him ſo, that he left his School and never return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it again.</hi> Then ſays <hi>Mr. Couden</hi> to the Boy, <hi>Have you a Pique or Prejudice at Mr.</hi> K? <hi>Yes, Sir, anſwered the Boy, becauſe he beat me; and made me leave his School. Have you Malice at him,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mr.</hi> Couden? <hi>What mean you, Sir, by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, anſwered the Boy? Could you wiſh to ſee his Soul in Hell? Wiſh you ill to his Soul? Have you a freedom to pray for his Soul,</hi> replied <hi>Mr.</hi> Coud. <hi>I will not ſay, Sir, that I wiſh his Soul in Hell,</hi> anſwered the Boy. And ſo ended this Dialogue. It made no ſtop in the Buſineſs: the Boy deponed with great freedom. Now, pray, conſider, what vaſt difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judges, tho' Laicks, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Dalkeeth,</hi> in a common Houſe, and our <hi>Scots</hi> Divines in the Houſe of God. And forget not to ponder well the Circumſtances of this Affair. Thoſe are cognoſcing the Cauſe of a Foreigner or Stranger, who was ſuppoſed to have tranſgreſſed againſt the Supream Powers of the Nation; Theſe ſit Judges on their own Country-man; yea, one near in Kin (by Office) to themſelves; and only alledged to be guilty of private Faults: <hi>Thoſe</hi> did caſt a Witneſs, tho he wiſhed the Perſon heartily well, againſt whom he was to depone; <hi>Theſe</hi> ſuſtained a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who plainly told them judicially, that he had a Prejudice at him, againſt whom he was to depone. For you are not here to look upon this as <hi>Mr. Couden</hi>'s Deed alone, but his Brethrens alſo. They are ſharers with him of this heinous Tranſgreſſion. It is a wonder they run nor out of the Church, when they heard <hi>Mr. Couden</hi> propoſe ſuch dreadful Interrogatories. It was far more becoming the duty of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel to have ſharply rebuked that Boy, for harbouring ſo long in his heart a Prejudice at one, that was once his <hi>Maſter,</hi> than thus to indulge and encourage him in his Sin. But they muſt be pardoned; for they were ſo mighty eager and not upon the purſuit of the Ruine and deſtruction of another Man in this Life, that they quite forgot the Eternal Salvation of that Boy's Soul in that to come.</p>

                  <p>WE muſt not leave this Buſineſs ſo abruptly; eſpecially conſidering that upon the Depoſition or Faith of this one Witneſs are mainly founded the principal and moſt material Reaſons of that Sentence paſſed againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (22 <hi>Oct.</hi> 96.) of which in its place. We ſhall here only name a few things, which it is very fit you know a little more diſtinctly and fully. 1. You ſee the Father plainly told the Judge, that his Son had a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice at Mr. <hi>K.</hi> The Son confirms what the Father had ſaid: yet neither of them prevails. And who elſe in the World can know this <hi>Prejudice</hi> ſo well, as Father and Son? 2. Both tell its riſe and occaſion. Mr. <hi>K. beat him ſo, that he left his School, and never return'd to it again.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> does indeed confeſs, that he beat him, and that deſervedly, but too gently. Nor did he any more return, having learnt his <hi>Latin,</hi> and ſome <hi>Greek,</hi> ſo went to College. The Cauſe of his being beaten, and the way it was done is thus, as many atteſt. While Mr. <hi>K.</hi> examing <hi>Theams,</hi> his Scholars ſitting about him in a <hi>Semicircle,</hi> one <hi>Rob. Handiſide,</hi> riſing from his Seat, advances little more than a pace to give his Maſter his <hi>Theam:</hi> In the mean while, <hi>James Broun</hi> gets into it. <hi>Handiſide</hi> complains: Mr. <hi>K.</hi> finding him wrong'd, commands <hi>Broun</hi> to riſe. He, in a manner refuſes, muttering ſomething within himſelf. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> giving him about the Shoulders with his Scourge, makes him to riſe. After this he did not return. Upon the like occaſion, he left Mr. <hi>George
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36252:45"/>
Adam</hi>'s School, who was Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s immediate Predeceſſor, now in <hi>Muſſilburgh.</hi> 3. This <hi>Prejudice</hi> continues ſome years, and ſo becomes rooted and fixed in the Heart. It was more than an ordinary <hi>Prejudice,</hi> that had laſted about 3 years. The Sun ſhould not once ſet in our wrath, ſay the holy Scriptures: here it aroſe and ſet above two thouſand times. Call it by what name you pleaſe, <hi>Envy, Hatred, Revenge;</hi> for it well deſerves any of theſe: Yea, <hi>Malice</hi> it ſelf, tho' not in Mr. <hi>Couden</hi>'s Senſe; For certainly in this point, he differs Infinitely from all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines on Earth. His is a wonderful kind of <hi>Malice: Malice</hi> as deep as <hi>Hell;</hi> as long and broad as <hi>Eternity;</hi> infinitely perfect in all its <hi>Dimenſions:</hi> and for its <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> it is unexpreſſible, being in every reſpect, as <hi>black</hi> as the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf. It is a Queſtion, if there be any Perſon on Earth ſo exceeding wicked and malicious; ſo curſed and helliſh, as to imitate Devils in that degeee, in a ſober fit to wiſh their Neighbour were in eternal Torture amongſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Flames. But whatever may be Men's private Thoughts, or ſecret Wiſhes, or raſh and inconſiderate Words in a Rage or Fury; yet it is madneſs it ſelf to ſuppoſe, that any perſon in the World, far leſs a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is ſo demented, as to ſay in face of a Judge; yea, in preſence of a Church Judicature, <hi>That he wiſheth his Neighbour's Soul were in Hell.</hi> And hence it is, one of the moſt fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh things in Nature to propoſe ſuch a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which is to be anſwered <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> or <hi>Negatively;</hi> and yet all the World will anſwer but one way. Was it not a wonderful Skip in Mr. <hi>Couden,</hi> to jump at once from the ſhort Miſeries of this Life to the everlaſting torment of that to come? He might have many thouſands of Queſtions at hand, all fitter for his purpoſe, than theſe above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Pray, what need was there to fetch them from Hell? Might he not have ſaid? <hi>Would you be glad to ſee Mr.</hi> K. <hi>ſo diſgraced, as to be put out of the Town by the hand of the Hangman?</hi> And it is very probable, he might wiſh ſome ſuch thing. Or, Mr. <hi>Couden</hi> might have gone higher; as, <hi>Could you deſire to ſee ſuch a Mark ſet on Mr.</hi> K. <hi>as the Lord put on</hi> Cain? Or, <hi>Could you ſee him caſt into the Lions Den with</hi> Daniel? Or, <hi>into a burning fiery Furnace, ſeven times hotter than ordinary with</hi> Shadrach, Meſhach <hi>and</hi> Abednigo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Know that this Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deponed more than other twenty, as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is informed, if not in <hi>Bulk,</hi> at leaſt in <hi>Quality.</hi> And hence it was, that by no means they would caſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many great things were expected from him. We have once and again, above told you, that what Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Adverſaries had moſt confidence in, did chifley fail them, and tended moſt to their hurt and diſgrace. This you clearly ſaw in the Buſineſs of <hi>Blakader,</hi> and in Mr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s Depoſition; but this in hand has quite ſunk them, and ſav'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> This, as you will hear in its place, made the Committee of Bills in <hi>Edenb.</hi> ſit as mute as Fiſh. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>Part.</hi> 5. 5.

But that which we judge moſt worthy our notice here, is the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way this Buſineſs came to the knowledge of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and others, <hi>viz.</hi> by the means of an <hi>Aſs:</hi> an <hi>Aſs</hi> from <hi>England.</hi> O happy, happy, thrice happy hour, in which this <hi>Aſs</hi> croſſed the Border! By this <hi>Aſs</hi> a great wonder is wrought in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a dark and hid Myſtery is brought to light. We read in holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. that an <hi>Aſs</hi> ſpoke (22 <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.) and reproved her Maſter the Prophet for beating her, who had ſaved his life.

Yea, we hope, ſhe has done more than ſaved his Temporary Life. The poor miſerable Youth was moſt pitifully miſled by blind Guides; but this Aſs has moſt providentially brought him back to the right Path: By that Aſs (at leaſt indirectly) the eyes of her Maſter were opened to ſee the Angel ſtanding with

Know alſo, that Graſs is not to be had in <hi>Kelſo</hi> near at hand, and this Aſs was not able to go to a place at a diſtance. To keep her continually within doors, they found agreed not with her Nature. She had a young Colt ſucking her, which added not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to this Inconveniency. Harveſt was begun (it being then 28 of <hi>Aug.</hi>) ſo that within 2 or 3 days at moſt, ſhe would get abundance of freſh Graſs in the Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to feed on. And therefore to ſupply the preſent neceſſity, the Father, with Dr. <hi>Trotter,</hi> Uncle to the Boy, went to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> on the ſaid 28 of <hi>Aug.</hi> and having repreſented to him all Circumſtances, humbly begg'd he would be pleaſed to ſuffer the Aſs to feed in the Church-yard, an hour or two in the day, till they got Graſs in the Stubbles near to their Houſe, which, ſay they, we will have within 2 or 3 days at moſt. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> flatly refuſed this very reaſonable and modeſt Requeſt; not upon any <hi>Superſtitious</hi> account, as if he would not ſuffer an Aſs to go in that place; he is not ſcrupulous in that point: his own two Horſes, four Cows, with flocks of Geeſe, Turky-cocks, Ducks, Cocks and Hens feed there: Yea, he is ſo far from being ſcrupulous or nice that way, that if any Man's Horſes (even after the time fields become freer to all) happen to come into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he preſently orders his Servants to drive them into the old Church, where for ſome days they are forced to eaſe Nature on the Corps of very worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Nor does he ordinarily let them go, till he and his Servants be ſatisfied for the Damage, the one ſuſtaining Loſs, the other Trouble and Pains. He has had theſe 2 years a poor Man's <hi>Chopin-Stoup</hi> and a Plate, and it is like, may have 'em to Eternity.

He is moſt ungrate to me, and cruel to my Son,</hi> ſaid the Father; <hi>a very Turk would not have denied me ſuch a Requeſt.</hi> And in truth, if you conſider Circumſtances, you will find Mr. <hi>J.</hi> guilty of great <hi>Inhumanity, Ingratitude, Imprudence</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice</hi> in this Buſineſs, to name no more Vices. The hurt or damage the Aſs could do Mr. <hi>J.</hi> was very inconſiderable, not amounting perhaps to 4 or 5 Shil. <hi>Scots</hi> in whole; and to put that in the ballance with the Health or Life of ſuch a Boy, his Father's only Son, is a ſtrange thing. That, which may exceedingly aggravate Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s Fault, or rather a multiplied Crime, are the Circumſtances of the Youths Parents: the Mother a vertuous Gentlewoman, related to the beſt Families in the Shire of <hi>Mars:</hi> the Father an old Man of good Eſteem, the chief Perſon in his Circumſtances in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> one that has been all his Life moſt

conſtant to his Principles, a <hi>true,</hi> but no <hi>Bigot Presbyterian.</hi> But that which is moſt conſiderable here, is, that not only he was and is in a capacity to do M. <hi>J.</hi> Service many ways, but had already done him ſeveral acts of great kindneſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly did contribute with others in giving Money for his neceſſary uſe, and many times made him very welcome in his Houſe with the beſt things he had.

Now, is there not here the hight of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> after ſo much kindneſs, ſo many favours done him, to deny ſo inconſiderable a Requeſt? <hi>Ingratitude!</hi> Certainly <hi>Ingratitude</hi> in a high degree; and if <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> what is it not according to the common Proverb, <hi>Si ingratum dixeris, omnia?</hi> See you not here a great act of <hi>Imprudence,</hi> a palpable ſign of <hi>Avarice, Incivility, Inhumanity,</hi> or rather <hi>Barbarity,</hi> &amp;c.

'Tis moſt evident to the World, that it was deſign'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſhould ſtill lie under the Blunder and Calumnies laid againſt him: For tho' the Presbytery had referred the Matter to the Synod, which was to ſit within 8 days thereafter, yet they did not cite him to the ſaid Synod, nor ſomuch as acquaint the Synod with the Buſineſs, ſo that it is more than preſumable he would not have been call'd before the Synod, if he had not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to their Wiſdoms by a Petition, which he gave in many hours after they were ſit down. And after conſideration had of the ſaid Matter by the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, it was referred to a Committee made up of the Presbytery and ſeveral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants. The E. of <hi>R.</hi> and his Lordſhip's Curators, knowing what Spirit theſe Libellers are of, they formerly upon ſeveral occaſions having oppoſed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and contemned his Authority, he judging that this whole Procedure againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is alſo a ſtriking againſt, and trampling upon his own Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, he being the main Inſtrument in bringing Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to this place; and being fully convinced of his Innocency of what is laid to his Charge, he therefore ſtated himſelf and his Curators, as Parties in defence of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> With very great reſpect and veneration for theſe Gentlemen, Miniſters and Elders, that are Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, it is offered that they with the Presbytery are very incompetent Judges in this Affair, for the above written Reaſons, and what follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard moſt part of the Aſſiſtants were abſent at the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dyets, when Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was called; ſo that, in effect, the Presbytery was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more numerous, and at ſome Dyets, the Presbytery did ſit by themſelves without any Aſſiſtant. And ſhould a thinking Man conſider the former Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of Seſſion and Presbytery, it cannot be expected, that they will proceed legally, as they ought to do. 2. They have appeared very <hi>Partial</hi> againſt M. <hi>K.</hi> by ſuffering Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and his Elders to ſit with them, to hear their Conſultations, when he and others concerned muſt wait at the Church-door. 3. It is evident that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and the Perſons, who contracted with him, are ſlighted, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> diſgraced (as one of their own number did acknowledge) and that by ſuffering Perſons of no worth or eſteem, to exerce the Offices belonging to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> 4. When they put <hi>Queries</hi> to him, and got his Anſwer therto, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the ſame in their Regiſter, they poſitively refuſed to read to him what was recorded; tho' he preſſed the ſame with many Arguments, which inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that they had recorded otherwiſe, than he had declared. 5. They, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Law, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> refuſed to give up the Names of their Informers of that Buſineſs of <hi>Blakader,</hi> tho' ſeriouſly and often required, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments taken thereon. And alſo, that they refuſed to diſcuſs the firſt two main Heads, which were ſtated before the Presbytery and Synod, e're they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on a new Libel, tho they again and again preſſed to it; but theſe they waved and ſhifted, falling on new Points. 6. Their Procedure againſt him is very ſtrange, for they determined a Probation of that new Libel againſt him, and that before the delivery thereof to him, and before the Relevancy of it was diſcuſſed, or the Libel denied. And Mr. <hi>K.</hi> having given in a Defence, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the Probation to go on; and that before they declare what they repel, or what they ſuſtain: and an Anſwer being made to this Defence by the Libellers,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36252:47"/>
which being very large, they refuſed the ordinary Dyet for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to reply, not allowing him to that effect a competent Time. 7. They refuſed to ſuffer the Libellers to give their Oath of Calumny, required thereto by way of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And tho' it is known they are moſt malicious, and dare not depone thereupon. Certainly nothing is more juſt, than that ſuch Accuſers give their Oaths of Calumny; for who can he free of ſuch like purſuits, if Perſons be not obliged to do it? 8. It is true, that there are ſeveral Witneſſes ſummoned, and a Liſt given to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to the Effect (in caſe they had gone on legally) he might have his Objections in readineſs againſt them. But ſo it is, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is evil, as appears by the Liſt of Witneſſes given him; for of 31 none are deſigned, except 2; ſo that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> knew not what Objections to have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there being 3, 4, or 5 Perſons of the ſame Name with ſeveral of theſe in the Liſt given; and that even in the Town of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> beſides what may be in the Country. And alſo, they have ſummoned Witneſſes, who are not in Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Liſt. 9. The Presbytery and Aſſiſtants have ſhewed themſelves very partial in their Procedure in this Affair; For tho' an Objection and Proteſtation was given in againſt Mr. <hi>J.</hi> that he could not Cognoſce, and ſit Judge, in regard he was a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and alſo had prejudice againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> And that he was main Contriver, and Former of the Libel and reply, and Carrier on of this Affair: yet he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſit in their Judicature, when Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and others concerned, were ordered to remove; and that even at the ſame time, when they were conſidering, and voting, whether he ſhould remove or not. 10. Though in Law they were not oblig'd to object in regard the Liſt of Witneſſes given in, did not bear their Deſignations, as ſaid is; and as to the Witneſſes, who are not contain'd in the ſaid Liſt, it cannot be expected objections ſhou'd be given in againſt them; neither can they be examined, unleſs Juſtice be overturn'd, and the form of Proceſs in ſuch Caſes altogether ranvers'd and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to the Laws and Practicks of this Kingdom, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil. However, the <hi>E.</hi> and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> wou'd have objected, as they now object. 1. No Witneſs can be examined in this Affair, until ſuch a time, as Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders give their Informers of that buſineſs about the Woman in <hi>Blakader;</hi> for, if Informers be not condeſcended on, none knows, but ſome of the Perſons, who are cited as Witneſſes, are the Informers. 2. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> is Liſted, as a Witneſs, who cannot be receiv'd for the Reaſons contain'd in the proceeding <hi>Paragraph,</hi> and Proteſtation taken. He alſo, as Miniſter of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and Member of Presbytery (as he deſigns himſelf) is conſequently a Judge in this Affair; and no Judge can be Witneſs when his depoſition makes a part of the probation. If this be ſuſtain'd, it were to Condemn a Man upon the Judges private knowledge; which is contrary to the Laws both of God and Man. 3. The former Objection rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a Member of Presbytery and Judge, is holden as repeated againſt Mr. <hi>Thomas Thomſon, Brevitatis cauſa;</hi> ſo that he cannot bear Witneſs, with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he is not only a Judge, but alſo Clerk: and whoſe evil deſign againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> muſt in this <hi>Paragraph</hi> appear, which renders him uncapable to be Judge, Witneſs, or Clerk, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis known to himſelf wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As for the other Miniſters of this Presbytery, or Synod, and Laick Elders, who are adduc'd, as Witneſſes; with very great reſpect to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it is offer'd by the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>R.</hi> and his Curators, at leaſt by theſe, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by his I.o. and alſo by Mr. <hi>K</hi> that they cannot here be adduc'd as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;

for the Reaſons contain'd in the former <hi>Paragraph, viz.</hi> becauſe they are Judges, not doubting, but they wou'd tell the truth; only 'tis an evil <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> without a <hi>Precedent</hi> 5. As to <hi>Jo. Broun</hi> Merchant (if this be the <hi>Jo. Broun</hi> in the Liſt) he cannot be receiv'd as a Witneſs, in regard 'tis offer'd to be prov'd by his Oath, that he has been upon Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and the Libellers Conſultations on this Affair, and that he has given advice there anent; and ſo Guilty of partial Counſel. 6. As to <hi>James Broun,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Johnſon,</hi> his Depoſition can make no faith againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> he not only being within the years allow'd for Witneſſes; but alſo granting he were paſt the years, 'tis offer'd to be prov'd that he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd officious by enquiring at others what they knew in this Affair; and he not being come to the years of Underſtanding; 'tis more than preſumable he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends either upon <hi>Hear-ſay,</hi> or in Revenge againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> he having left his School in-Pique, and to this day minds it; for he never owns Mr. <hi>K.</hi> more than the greateſt ſtranger on Earth. (See Sect. 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 7. As to <hi>(b)</hi> Mr. <hi>Wear's</hi> Letter, which is liſted, as a Witneſs, no reſpect can be had thereto; ſeeing, <hi>Teſte, non Teſtimonia probant;</hi> and all Witneſſes muſt be examined in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Defender, and Aſſize; that is, in preſence of Mr. <hi>K</hi> and his Judges. 8. Theſe Witneſſes that live without the juriſdiction of this provincial Synod, 'tis humbly offered to the conſideration of this reverend judicature, whether they appearing by a <hi>(c)</hi> Citation founded upon the Warrant of this Presbytery, or Synod, will oblige them to appear; or, if they muſt have a Warrant from another judicature; for in caſe this Synods Warrant does not teach them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their juriſdiction, ſuch Witneſſes, who appear by Virtue of ſo incompetent a Warrant, ſeem to be <hi>

Ja. <hi>at which time, theſe in</hi> Lithgo, <hi>that favour'd his way (both the above mention'd Parties <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting in one againſt the</hi> Epiſcopal) <hi>call'd him back to be Preacher in the Meeting-houſe there. While he was yet living in</hi> Ireland <hi>and preaching in a Meeting-houſe in</hi> Culrain, <hi>and not the leaſt word of his coming back to</hi> Scotland; <hi>he ſent one of his Sons to be educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Mr</hi> K. <hi>having only heard of his name or fame. And when he came himſelf, about</hi> 3 <hi>years thereafter, and was ſettled Miniſter in the Meeting-houſe there, he put another Son to Mr.</hi> K's <hi>School. In a word; tho' Mr.</hi> K. <hi>did conſtantly keep the Church, never ſo much as once going to the Meeting-houſe; yet Mr.</hi> W. <hi>and he liv'd moſt friendly and neighbourly, viſiting one another like two Brethren, and that after his Sons were gone from his School. As to the Letter here mention'd, and adduc'd as a Witneſs, at leaſt given up to Mr.</hi> K. <hi>in the Liſt of Witneſſes, he knows not ſo much as one ſingle word, that's in it; for, tho' he preſs'd hard in face of a judicature to have it produc'd and read; which thing Mr.</hi> J. <hi>would on no means ſuffer to be done. Hence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36252:48"/>
you may eaſily conjecture, what be the Contents of the ſaid Letter; for certainly, if it had made any againſt Mr.</hi> K. <hi>it had been produc'd: and to conceal it, if it make for him, is a great act of injuſtice. This is down-right Mr.</hi> Couden<hi>'s Principle above related,</hi> Sect. 20. viz. <hi>What makes againſt</hi> Mr. <hi>K. ought to be recorded, but if othewiſe there is no need.</hi> (c) <hi>Some Witneſſes were cited after a moſt illegal and ſtrange manner. The Kirk Officer forſooth, wrote Letters ſo to me, ordering them to appear. Thus was Mr.</hi> Colvil, <hi>School-maſter in</hi> Jedburgh; <hi>ſummon'd. Mr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>Brother-in-Law to Mr.</hi> Glen, <hi>who, as we told you,</hi> Sect. 12. <hi>did diſpute with his fellow Witneſſes, while they were deponing, came from the Viſcount of</hi> Arbuthnet's <hi>Houſe in the North, about</hi> 86 <hi>miles diſtant from</hi> Kelſo, <hi>upon a bare Letter, as he confeſſed himſelf to Mr.</hi> K. <hi>and deponed, which is a thing altogether contrary to Law, and make; him an</hi> ultronious <hi>Witneſs. Yea, the Presbytery of</hi> Kelſo <hi>dare do far greater things than theſe. They can ſend their Officer to other Kingdoms without an Order from any Perſon therein to Summon witneſſes to appear before them. This they did to one</hi> Marg. Home <hi>in</hi> Work. <hi>And is't not very pretty, think you, thus to fetch Men's Wives from</hi> England <hi>to ſtand before the Church Judicatures in</hi> Scotland? <hi>If this Woman did appear, ſhe alſo was an</hi> ultronious <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for no Law oblig'd her to do it. It were tedious, but very pertinent to tell you here, how illegal and informal they were in their Citations of Mr.</hi> K. <hi>Only take this touch. His Summons did not bear particularly at whoſe inſtance he was to appear: but only in a kind of general terms,</hi> viz. At the Inſtance of ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Kelſo.

                     <hi>A remarkable Paſſage.</hi> 'Tis very pertinent here to give an account of a buſineſs, which we hinted at already, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. and there promiſed to touch more fully here. Tho' it ſeem a thing of no great Importance in it ſelf; yet will be found to be very ſerviceable in ſeveral Points of his Proceſs. 'Tis this. One <hi>B.

B.</hi> Notar-publick in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> being cited to appear before this Synod, to depone againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was call'd in, and her Oath taken. This being done, the <hi>Mod.</hi> ask'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> if he had any thing to object againſt her, why ſhe might not depone in this Proceſs. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> after he had taken a glance with his Eye of the Womans Countenance, anſwer'd, he had nothing to object againſt her, having never, that he knew, ſeen her, or heard of her in his Life before that time. And ſuſpecting, that ſhe was to depone upon <hi>Hear-ſay,</hi> as many had done before her; ask'd her, whether ſhe was to declare any thing, as ſhe was inform'd by others? Or what ſhe had ſeen, or heard herſelf done or ſpoken amiſs by him? <hi>I am,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, <hi>to declare what I have heard another ſay of you; for I never ſaw any ill in you my ſelf; nor ever had the occaſion to ſee it. Mod.</hi> ſays Mr. K. <hi>This Woman is not to depone againſt me, but againſt ſome other Perſon, which I am apt to think is the Woman in</hi> Blakader. <hi>If ſhe has any thing to lay to my Charge, let her declare it here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. If another Perſon has inform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d her of any ill in me, ſhe cannot depone, till that Perſon be preſent, and they be confronted.</hi> Up riſes Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Mod. ſince this Woman was cited, and has appear'd, I think ſhe may depone. With Mr.</hi> S<hi>'s leave, Mod.</hi> anſwer'd Mr. K. <hi>ſince the other Woman is not preſent; yea, nor cited to be here, this Woman ought not to depone, it being contrary to Law, that any Perſon depone in abſence of the Perſon againſt whom they depone, or their Proctour; for</hi> Mod. <hi>you do not know what the Woman in</hi> Blakader <hi>may have to ſay againſt this Woman, why ſhe cannot depone in this Matter. Mod.</hi> replied Mr. <hi>S. ſince the Woman has not only been cited, but has appeared, and her Oath taken; we cannot now ſend her home without hearing what ſhe has to ſay in this Affair. Mod.</hi> anſwered Mr. <hi>K. One fault ought not to be the Cauſe, or made the occaſion of another. It was a fault in the Kirk-Seſſion to cite the one without the other; and now to make this Woman depone in the others ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, eſpecially it not being her fault, that ſhe is abſent is another Fault greater than the former, upon many accounts, particularly, becauſe 'tis contrary to an Expreſs Act of Parliament, requiring that all Witneſſes be Examined in preſence of the Parties or their Advocates,</hi> 18 Act. K. James 7. Seſſ. 2. Firſt Parl. 14 <hi>June</hi> 1686. <hi>That which Mr.</hi> S. <hi>founds his Argument on, is a matter of inconveniency only; for there is no real evil in the thing, only a trouble to the Woman to have appear'd in vain, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again at another time. Whereas Mod. I found my Argument upon a Principle of Equity and Juſtice, that ought to be done both to the Woman in</hi> Blakader <hi>and my ſelf, but chiefly to the Woman in</hi> Blakader; <hi>for nothing this Woman can ſay, will in Law militate againſt me, ſince ſhe is only to depone on Hear-ſay.</hi> Notwithſtanding all Mr. <hi>K.</hi> could ſay, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> being, it ſeems aſham'd to be run down by a Country <hi>Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>int, crav'd that it might be recorded in their Regiſter, that he made this Objection; or that the ſaid <hi>Beſſy</hi> depon'd with a <hi>Qualification; viz.</hi> in abſence of the Perſon againſt whom ſhe depon'd. At this <hi>Mr. S.</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Brethren, cry'd out, that upon no account they would do that; for,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36252:49"/>
thought they, this is to record our own <hi>Doom;</hi> and to publiſh to the World, that we have done unjuſt things. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſtill urged the thing, ſaying, he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing, but what was moſt juſt and equitable, and pertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. What? cry two or three together; Muſt we Record every thing he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Well, <hi>Mod.</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Mr. K. If ye will not Record it, ye cannot hinder me to do it;</hi> and with that, he throws the Inſtrument Money down on the Table, ſaying, <hi>I proteſt againſt your procedure in this particular,</hi> &amp;c. Then indeed they look'd one to another; till at length, the <hi>Mod.</hi> ſays, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> take back your Money, and remove a little; and you ſhall have the mind of the Synod in-the matter. He with theſe Commiſſionated from the <hi>E.</hi> being removed, the Synod very quickly came to a Determination, there being an abſolute neceſſity, that one of three ſhould be done. Either the Woman was to go home without deponing, or they were to Record their own Illegal Procedure; or ſuffer <hi>Mr. K.</hi> to proteſt. All three were mighty biting, and gall'd ſome of the Synod to the very heart. Others ſaw not the Inconveniency, or rather the Evil of the firſt; and therefore ſaid, <hi>What hurt is there that this Woman go home at this time? She, and that other may come both together, at another occaſion; the laſt two,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>are intolerable, we cannot admit of either of them.</hi> The Evil of the firſt, (which was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly diſcern'd by a few) is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; for, 1. 'Tis an infallible Demonſtration, that the Synod condemns the Procedure of the ſaid Committee (24. <hi>Sep.</hi>) who examined a vaſt number of Witneſſes, meerly upon <hi>Hear-ſay,</hi> in all abſence of thoſe, againſt whom they depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſequently accuſes them of Injuſtice; and ſo in Law renders Null th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t they did. 2. This <hi>Beſſy Thomſon,</hi> from whom, it ſeems, they expected great things (tho' in effect to no purpoſe) cannot depone, but in preſence of that Woman in <hi>Blakader.</hi> whom they dare not adduce, tho' the chief Perſon of any, that ſhould appear in this Particular, and <hi>Mr. K.</hi> has provok'd thers to it, and that by way of Inſtrument, as is above related. It was upon the conſideration of theſe two Heads, which moved <hi>Mr. K.</hi> to be ſo eager and preſſing, that the ſaid <hi>Beſſy</hi> ſhould go home, as ſhe came; and the Contrary moved <hi>Mr. S.</hi> and others to be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſhe ſhould depone; for, as by the one, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> was to gain a great Point; ſo they on the other hand, loſt one no leſs. In ſhort, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in again, was told by the <hi>Mod.</hi> that <hi>Beſſy</hi> was to go home without deponing, under which Oath ſhe lies to this day (1 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1698.) and now likely will lie till ſhe go before the Great Judge of the World. We cannot here omit to tell you, that this <hi>Beſſy</hi> was again cited about half a year thereafter to appear upon that ſame occaſion before a Committee. <hi>Mr. K.</hi> ſeeing her and no other Woman elſe within the Church, ſaid, as 'twere in a ſurprize, but with a ſmile, <hi>Mod. Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is come back again, but in the ſame Circumſtances ſhe was in before, viz. without her Neighbour in</hi> Blakader. <hi>Go home, Go home,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sir John Pringle</hi> to her, <hi>till you have your Neighbour with you.</hi> 'Tis more than probable, if this worthy Gentleman had not been preſent, they had cauſed <hi>Beſſy</hi> to depone, contrary to the Judgment of the Synod. We leave to you, to make what Inferences you think fit from theſe two appearances of <hi>Beſsy,</hi> and the very odd Circumſtances relating thereto. Only in general, you clearly ſee, that what makes againſt <hi>Mr. K.</hi> they put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Regiſter; but what makes for him, they ſuffer the Wind to carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. We could give you ſome hundreds of Inſtances; but ſhall only name this one for all. This day (15 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1695.) <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> of <hi>Blakader,</hi> a Member of the Synod, did declare in face of that Judicature, that he was not at home, but in the Fields a great way from his Houſe, Tithing his Tenants Corn at that time; when the Libellers alledge he was in his Croſer, and his ſtirring therein, parted <hi>Mr. K.</hi> and the Woman, ſtruggling together. Now know, that <hi>Mr. K.</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Mr. Gaudy,</hi> Clerk to the Synod, if this ſo Solemn a Declaration of <hi>Sir J. H.</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:36252:49"/>
was Recorded, or not; and found that it was not. Ay but, had it concern'd the other ſide of the Houſe, it would not have been omitted.</p>
                  <p>We now go on to tell you, that the Synod adjourning about 6 a Clock, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſits in <hi>James Duncan</hi>'s till near Mid-night; <hi>Mr. K.</hi> all that time waited on in the ſaid Houſe, expecting every minute to be called, but was not; nor the whole following day, the Synod, Committee, and Sub-Committee ſat till 12 at Night. After Mid-night, <hi>Sir J.H.</hi> and <hi>Sir J. P.</hi> went to <hi>Stitchel,</hi> 2 Miles diſtant, and returned next Morning between 8 and 9, but before they entred the Church, a <hi>Fital</hi> ſtroke was given. The Synod had paſs'd a Sentence, which has been ſince the occaſion of much Debate, great Trouble, and vaſt Expence. If it had pleas'd their Wiſdoms to have delay'd the matter, till theſe two worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came, very likely things would have come to an Accomodation; for theſe two Gentlemen did what lay in their Power, both the ſaid two Days and Nights to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ng them to a happy Concluſion. And tho' they were exceeding weary (and no wonder) going to Bed about three a Clock, having Supp'd at two, yet got up betimes and drew a Paper before they came from <hi>Stitchel</hi> to be Subſcribed by <hi>Mr. K.</hi> which certainly would have given Satisfaction to the far greateſt part of the Synod. <hi>Sir J. Pringle</hi> went ſtrait to the Church, and as he was entring, he hears the Vote going about. <hi>Sir J. Home</hi> came to <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Houſe, and ſhew'd him the ſaid Paper; but before it was well read over, word came that a Sentence was paſt: So that all the great Labour and Toil theſe two Perſons of Honour had taken, came to nought. Many of the Brethren ſore Repented this afterwards, and ſought for an Accommodation, but could never have it in the terms they then had in their offer; as you ſhall ſee in its place.</p>

                  <p>WEre it not, that you are to have a pretty large Account of the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Synod, in that above mentioned Paper given into the Synod at <hi>Jedburgh (Sect.</hi> 13 <hi>Part</hi> 4) we could not paſs here ſo ſlightly ſeveral things of very great moment, as to <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s part; and yet matters there are not delivered ſo fully and lively as could be wiſh'd, in reſpect he was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ot a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtraitned in time, ſeveral other buſineſſes of no ſmall Concern occurring. Nor can we now, at leaſt we will not, make any alteration in that Paper, leſt our Adverſaries ſhould think, that we wrong them by making things appear in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſs, than once they were in. All we ſhall ſay here, may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſee in the <hi>Sentence,</hi> that the Overture of the Committee being Read, and <hi>Maturely</hi> (as they ſay) conſidered, is approved by Vote of Synod. By <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely,</hi> here certainly is meant <hi>Duly,</hi> or <hi>Seriouſly;</hi> whereas in effect it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be taken in alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Farly, Speedily,</hi> or <hi>Haſtily.</hi> We hate to Jangle about the various acceptation of Words; but far rather love to ſpeak home to the matter in hand. In ſhort therefore, we da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e poſitively aſſert that the Synod, and its Committees had ſit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for themſelves, the buſineſs could not be <hi>Maturely,</hi> or <hi>Duly</hi> conſidered: that is, Canvaſs'd as it ought to be, <hi>Modo &amp; more debito;</hi> as Juſtice and Law require. It this be not done, 'tis to paſs Sentence againſt a Perſon <hi>(Indicta Cauſa)</hi> without hearing him. You may as well not Cite him before you, as not to call him in, till it be to hear his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence read. 'Tis all one, as if you ſhould ſend him word by your Officer; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one of your number to acquaint him, that a Sentence is paſt ſo and ſo. Now, is not this down right <hi>Mr. K</hi>'s Caſe? Yea, and the Earl's alſo. Sentence is paſt on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36252:50"/>
both, without hearing them ſpeak one word in their Cauſe. And yet <hi>M.</hi> J. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, the Chief and Principal perſon of the oppoſite Party, is permitted to ſit amongſt the Judges, and plead his own Cauſe. If this be not <hi>Partiality</hi> in the Judges, there never was any in the World. 2. Lo, here is a Sentence without any Reaſon, except the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the Judge. A new ſort of thing, never, that we know, heard of in the World before. Ay, but there's much worſe in it, than perhaps you are aware of. See you not ſomething wrapt up within its boſom, like Poiſon: Deadly Poiſon. 'Tis not much unlike the thing, which ſome call <hi>Couper-juſtice;</hi> firſt to hang a man, and then to appoint an Aſſize; to make Enquiry, whether or not, he deſerves ſo ſevere a Puniſhment. We need not be at great pains to make Application; he that Runs may read, the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Sun at Noon-Tide. The Synod, you ſee, by their Sentence declare <hi>M. K.</hi> unfit to Officiate, as Seſſion-Clerk and Precentor; and yet they appoint a Committee to conſider, whether he be guilty of ſuch Faults, as render him unfit for the ſaid Offices. Now, pray ſpeak Ingenuouſly; Think you that theſe Men, who by their Sentence Pronounc'd, as they ſay, after <hi>Mature Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> have declared him unfit this day, will by another Proclaim him fit to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, contradicting the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Synod; and conſequently Condemning both them and themſelves as guilty of Injuſtice. All Judges, you know, ought to be <hi>(In Aequilibrio)</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>Indifferency</hi> to Condemn or Aſſoil a man according as they find juſt cauſe for either of theſe: Whereas there is a kind of neceſſity laid on this Committee to adhere to the Sentence, which they have already paſſed. They have now a ſtrong <hi>Byaſs</hi> to draw them to one of the ſides. It will be aforc'd <hi>Putt</hi> and Stretch, to make them to Revoke what they have done in this point. 'Tis hard to Imagine, what anſwer can be given to ſatisfy any Indefferent Perſon in this matter. Perhaps you will ſay (yea, you muſt ſay it, otherwiſe it is not poſſible you can free your ſelf from the abovementioned <hi>Prepoſterous,</hi> and <hi>Arſe-ward</hi> way of giving men <hi>Couper juſtice</hi>) that 'tis not on the account of any Clauſe or Article in the Libel, that the Synod declared <hi>M. K.</hi> unfit for the ſaid Offices, but for ſome other reaſon, which they thought not fit to name in their Sentence. This is to run out of the <hi>Dub,</hi> as we ſay, into the <hi>Mire,</hi> a thing far worſe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. By this means you condemn a man without either <hi>Libel, Citation,</hi> or <hi>Hearing:</hi> Nor will you tell him, wherefore you do it. O how will Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſtand Amazed to hear of ſuch Wild Acts!</p>
                  <p>The moſt aſtoniſhing thing in all this Buſineſs is, that the Synod (at leaſt by far the greateſt part) did paſs this Sentence, not knowing upon what ground they did it. Some of themſelves told M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>K.</hi> ſince, that the Reaſon why they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him unfit, was on the account of the Differences between the Kirk-Seſſion and him: which thing, ſaid they, we do not remember was ever ſo much as moved or tabled before the Synod, but only conſidered by a few in private. To this Mr. <hi>K.</hi> replied, 1. That it was a very great fault in theſe few leading Men ſo to impoſe on their Brethren, as to make them act blindly in a matter of ſuch, Importance: and was alſo a ſign of great weakneſs (to call it no worſe) in theſe Brethren to be ſo eaſily impoſed upon. 2. 'Tis an act, ſaid he, of great Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to paſs a Sentence on any Perſon without firſt hearing what he has to ſay for himſelf. You do not know, but Mr. <hi>K.</hi> could have inſtructed, that theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Kirk-Seſſion and him, had their riſe from them and not from him: and to puniſh him for their Crimes is a moſt horrid Iniquity. And therefore he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orted the Argument upon Mr. J. and his Elders; ſaying, they were more unfit for their reſpective Offices on the account of the great Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no only between them and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> but (which is far more conſiderable) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the greateſt part of the Pariſh; eſpecially thoſe of the beſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36252:51"/>
Quality and Note in the place. And certainly, if matters were well conſidered, it will be found that theſe Debates and Differences in the Pariſh do ariſe more from the wild carriage of the Members of Seſſion, than from any other Perſon concern'd with them. The laſt Obſerve we ſhall make here on this Sentence, is Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s ſad Complaint, that notwithſtanding he gave in to the Synod Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Appeal, containing very many groſs and palpable Faults, whereof the ſaid Committee was guilty; yet no regard was had thereto, as it ſuch a thing had never been; for they did not ſo much as once call for him, either to hear the ſaid Reaſons, or the Depoſitions of Witneſſes read over. People are hugely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, when he tells them that he never once ſaw the Depoſitions, not heard them read over in his Life: and you know very well that a particular account of Circumſtances does often make a buſineſs appear quite another thing from what it ſeemed to be at firſt view.</p>

                     <hi>NOvemb.</hi> 12. 1695. This day Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was ſummoned at Mr. J's Inſtance to appear at one and the ſame moment before the Sheriff at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> on the account of the ſaid Brew-houſe or Vault, and before the Committee at <hi>Kelſo,</hi> for an expreſſion in his defence of the laſt Article of the ſaid Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An explication of theſe words you have in the <hi>Remark D.</hi> on the ſaid Defence, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Anſwer to the 15 Article. Now let the world judge, how unreaſonable it is, eſpecially in a Miniſter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to require that his Neighbour perform things which are ſimply impoſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> to be at one time in two places 6 or 7 miles diſtant. 'Tis a ſilly Anſwer to ſay, that he may be perſonally preſent at the one place, and by his Proctour at the other. To paſs, that thereby he may ſuſtain great hurt as to his Plea, and alſo be put to greater Expences. beſides theſe two Reaſons, we ſay, know that Mr. <hi>Ports</hi> Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Proctour was ſummoned alſo at Mr. J's Inſtance to appear at <hi>Kelſo</hi> before the Committee for ſome Words he had ſpoken, that did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour well in Mr. J's Ears: ſo that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was put to ſeek a new Proctour, and to inform about the particulars of his Plea. Thus to vex Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and to put him to much needleſs Trouble and Expence, is, it ſeems, Mr. J's delight and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. You will have more of this kind of ſtuff thereafter; but one piece you will find blood-red, like the fineſt Scarlet, dazling the Eyes to look on't. In plain terms, you ſhall ſee Mr. <hi>K.</hi> at one and the ſame time ſummoned at Mr. J's Inſtance, both before the Sheriff at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> and before the Lords of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Privy Council, with about 50 Witneſſes to depone againſt him, among whom was his Proctour, Mr. <hi>Potts.</hi> Of which Buſineſs in its place, <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>Par.</hi> 5.

The Reaſon, why I enquire ſo narrowly into this matter, is, that I know certainly that the former Committee that ſat in Spring and Summer laſt, met frequently without Advertiſing ſeveral Members, eſpecially the Gentlemen; particularly that Grand Meeting, as to any Action, as of</hi> Sept. <hi>laſt, when above</hi> 30 <hi>Witneſſes were to be Examined: at which time, not one of the Aſſiſtants were preſent, except Mr.</hi> Conden: <hi>And certainly, if theſe Worthy Gentlemen, had been at that Meeting, the many groſs and illegal ſteps made that day, would not have been committed. And</hi> Mod. <hi>I muſt beg liberty to tell you, that I have too too much ground to ſuſpect, that your Meetings are</hi> Pack'd, <hi>and made up on purpoſe to carry on an unjuſt deſign.</hi> Mod. <hi>I expect, and hope that you will pardon this freedom. I am ſo exceedingly concern'd in this Affair, that I am forced, I know not how, to ſpeak many things much contrary to my Inclination. Not only my Fortune and Livelyhood, but that, which is far dearer to me, my Reputation and Credit; yea, I may ſay, my very Life is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I can inſtance,</hi> Mod. <hi>ſeveral Gentlemen, that told they were not Advertiſed to meet the ſaid</hi> 24 of <hi>Sept. particularly, Sir</hi> John Pringle <hi>of</hi> Stitchel. <hi>And if he, that lives ſo near, got no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, much leſs would they get, who live at a distance. Sir</hi> J.

I offer</hi> Mod. <hi>to Inſtruct, that Sir</hi> John Pringle <hi>was at home in his own houſe at</hi> Stitchel, <hi>ſeveral days before the ſaid</hi> 24 <hi>of</hi> Sept. <hi>and particularly that day: And how can this he unknown to Mr.</hi> Glen, <hi>who lives, we may ſay, at Sir</hi> John<hi>'s very Gate, judge you.

And grant it was ſo; it does not follow, that the Earl of</hi> Roxb <hi>is obliged to cede from his Right becauſe the Magiſtrates of</hi> Lithgo <hi>have parted with theirs, and who knows, but their Succeſſors may recall, what they have done A. Remark on the Direction of</hi> Mr. K<hi>'s Petition.</hi> Mr. K. <hi>was challenged, tho' not directly, yet openly in face of the Committee of</hi> hills <hi>by two or three Brethren, that his Petition was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected after the ordinary Form. He not being ſpoken to by the</hi> Mod <hi>upon that Head, nor directly challenged by theſe Miniſters, opened not his mouth, not knowing well what they meant In private he asked one whom he knew he might be free with, what the matter was, 'Tis, anſwered the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, becauſe you direct your Petition, To his Grace, His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner, and the Reverend</hi> Mod. <hi>&amp; an Whereas other Petitions run only, To the Reverend</hi> Mod. <hi>&amp;c. For, you know, they look not on the Commiſſioner as an Eſſential Member of the Aſsembly, in regard he gives not his Vote. Mr. replyed</hi> Mr. K. <hi>I will not at preſent enter upon that debate, Whether he be an Eſſential Member, or not. All I ſay, is, that his Grace ſitting there, as repreſenting the</hi> King <hi>himſelf, I humbly conceive, he ought not to be paſſed by, as a Cypher, or a Perſon not to be regarded; Yea,

                     <hi>But, Sir, I have more to ſay for my ſelf upon this Head, than perhaps others will pretend to. You ſee, by my Petition and inſtrument, that my Plea is partly Eccleſiaſtical, partly Civil. Now, Sir, I muſt tell you, to my ſad Experience, that the Church has already dipt too far into the Civil part of my Proceſs. They have far tranſgreſs'd their bounds, and got over the Hedge into their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Fields<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This, Sir, you ſaw, I did hint at before your Committee. But, if my buſineſs come to be debated publickly before the G. A. as I hope it ſhall, I will be neceſſitated to be more plain Now, Sir, you know, that it is the Office and Duty of my Lord Commiſſioner to ſee that ye keep within your own Bounds; and that by no means ye encroach upon any man's Right and Property: and if his Grace ſhould find that ye attempt to tranſgreſs your true Limits, he can cuth you, and order you to retire, which if ye refuſe to do, its in his power to diſſolve you</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirkwood, ſaid the Gentleman, that's a very thorny Theam: we will let it alone at preſent. I ſhall be glad to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large upon it with you at a more convenient time. I know very well, that there are many good and learned men of your judgment; but 'tis as ſure there are ſome among us, who think otherwiſe. The great difficulty is to aright to ride the marches, as we ſay, between Church and State. We often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a very fit compariſon, reply'd the Gentleman; I have often found it ſo. And with this, Company coming in, they were neceſſitated to break off that Diſcourſe.</hi>

That the School is under a great Decay, and almoſt broken, and unlikely ever to recover, while he is in it, by reaſon of the evil Fame he is under, and the not profiting of Children either in Learning, or Religion under him.

That he entred without the Approbation of the Preſbytery, never having preſented any <hi>Grant</hi> by the E. of <hi>R.</hi> and his Curators to the ſaid Preſbytery; not having been tryed by them, as he ſhould have been according to the Act of the G.

A. 4. That the bad Fame he is under by his own Confeſſion, and raiſed by himſelf, not without preſumption of Guilt in the Matter concerning the Woman with Child; and from which he never purged himſelf, is ſufficient, if there were no more, to render him uncapable to be a School Maſter in ſuch a conſiderable Place as <hi>Kelſo;</hi> and will render him contemptible to his Scholars, who are not ignorant of it. A. 5. That he is a Man of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Principles in matters of Religion, as his Book, and Depoſition of Witneſſes do declare, which incapacitates any Man from being a School Maſter in a Reformed Church, where Children ſhould have a Religious Education. A. 6. That by the Depoſition of Witneſſes, it is plainly manifeſt, that he is a Man of a profane Spirit, which cannot but be very influential to the corrupting of Youth in their Morals, who are under his Education. A. 7. That it is plainly prov'd; yea, and notour, that he hath no Authority over his Scholars, to keep them in good Order. A. 8. That he is much addicted to lying, and ſelf-contradiction, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his Information to Sir <hi>J.

A. 9. That he is guilty of manifeſt Slanders, both againſt the Miniſter and Elders, as by his Papers may appear, by reaſon whereof he can never be an uſeful School-Maſter in this place, there being cauſe for all well-affected to with-hold or withdraw their Children from his School. A. 10. That he has manifeſtly combin'd with the Party which oppoſeth a Goſpel Miniſtry in this place, and is Clerk to the Curate for Clandeſtine Marriages and Baptiſms. A. 11. That his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath been moſt inſolent and unbecoming before the Judicatures of the Church upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions, when he hath been call'd to appear before them, as hath been obſerved by all Beholders. A. 12. That he doth what in him lieth to be vexatious to the Miniſter, by Summoning him before the Lords; and alſo by Summoning him to the Commiſſary Court, and by Petitioning the Bailyff to ſettle him in the Profits and Emoluments belonging to the Precentor and Seſſion-Clerk, and that ſince the Sentence of the Synod againſt him. A. 13. That he hath moſt maliciouſly and groſly ſlandered the Reverend Mr. <hi>T. Thomſon</hi> (in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Appeal to the Synod) as a Prevaricator and a Lyar. A. 14. That he hath malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, without any Cauſe, arreſted Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s Stipend, in the hands of Sir <hi>W.

K J.</hi> 7th <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 2 <hi>Parl.</hi> 14 <hi>June</hi> 1686, expreſly appointing the publication of the Teſtimonies of Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>An Anſwer to the Petition and Paper annexed thereto, given in againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Synod, ſitting on his Affair, laſt of <hi>March,</hi> 1696.</p>
                  <p>BEfore we make any particular Anſwer, let us obſerve in general. 1. <hi>By theſe Papers 'tis most evident to all that ſee them. That the Libellers (or rather Mr. J. Compoſer thereof) have had the uſe of the Proceſs, particularly the Depoſitions of Witneſſes, which diſcovereth great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and injuſtice in the Judges who poſitively refuſed the like Benefit to the Defender, tho' Law and Reaſon plead for him; and tho' he most earneſtly, and that frequently by way of Inſtrument has crav'd that Favour, or rather Juſtice of them. 2. It evidently appears by the ſaid Papers, that</hi> Mr. K<hi>'s Accuſers are become (as 'ſwere) his Judges; yea, have already given out Sentence againſt him.</hi> Some things, <hi>ſay they</hi> are Notar; ſome confeſs'd by himſelf; ſome prov'd by Witneſſes: <hi>Hence they infer, that he's unworthy of the Office he bears. Whoſoever ſeriouſly conſiders this whole Affair, can't but ſtand amaz'd thereat. All the</hi> Divines <hi>in</hi> Mers <hi>and</hi> Tiviotdale, <hi>with an equal Number of very knowing and worthy Gentlemen (for moſt part) the ruling Elders (not to mention Correſpondents from other places) have met in Synods, Committees, Sub-Committees,</hi> 20 <hi>or</hi> 30 <hi>times about this Buſineſs, and have conſidered it with all the advantages imaginable, as to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers part, yet could not find ground for a Sentence againſt him: And certainly never were men (we mean the generality only) more deſirous to find a fault in their Neighbour, than they are. An evidence of this may appear from a Propoſal one of the great</hi> Champions <hi>amongſt them made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Committee, after the Buſineſs had been canvaſs'd by a Synod,</hi> 2 <hi>days, and moſt part of</hi> 2 <hi>nights, and yet no ground could be found for a Sentence.</hi> Come, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſince we can't have two concurring Witneſſes for one Fault, may we not paſs Sentence on the Depoſitions of two Witneſſes on ſeveral Faults? <hi>For example; one depon'd that Mr.</hi> K. <hi>is diſsaffected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that he did not whip one of his Scholars for drinking K.</hi> James<hi>'s Health at his Table. Another, ſaid he, ſpoke Bawdy, telling a ſtory about</hi> Keegrels. <hi>This Brother's Opinion was rejected, eſpecially by the Gentlemen, as a thing contrary to Law, and never before practiſed. But Mr.</hi> K's <pb n="107" facs="tcp:36252:56"/>
                     <hi>Accuſers clearly ſee ſufficient ground for a Sentence:</hi> This is Notar, <hi>ſay they,</hi> That he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other is clearly prov'd by Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c. Now, is it not, think you, a very ſtrange and wonderful thing, that five</hi> ſilly, ſimple, ignorant, <hi>and</hi> illeterate <hi>Men ſhould ſee more, than a vaſt Number of learned</hi> Divines, <hi>and moſt knowing Gentlemen? 'Tis commonly ſaid, that</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the Mother of Devotion: <hi>but here is a greater Myſtery.</hi> Ignorance furniſheth the Underſtanding with ſuch Light, that it can clearly ſee that, which is not. <hi>Yes indeed: It can eaſily do that, when leaven'd with Malice, Envy, and Intereſt. We could adduce a good number of moſt convincing Arguments to ſhew the great deſire in the Judges and Libellers to find a Fault in Mr.</hi> K. <hi>were it not tedious here to relate them. Pray, conſider;</hi> 1. <hi>The vaſt Number of Things they charge him with; above a hundred Points or Articles, if they were well reckoned.</hi> 2. <hi>How they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Libel after Libel; Libel after Libel.</hi> 3. <hi>The great Multitude of Witneſſes, that have been adduced, and that not all at once.

Some of the very Judges (Miniſters we mean) in a private manner a king his Scholars and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers what evil they knew of him. Others enquiring into publick Innes, if at any time they ſaw him drunk. And eſpecially</hi> Mr. J. <hi>writing Letters to every place where Mr.</hi> K. <hi>liv'd, particularly to</hi> Lithgo <hi>and</hi> Culros. 6. <hi>How that after many things, wherewith he was charged, were found to be abominable Lyes and Calumnies (as that Buſineſs in</hi> Blakader) <hi>yet his Judges did never aſſoil him from them: but ſtill received in new Libels, being fully, it ſeems, reſolv'd never to give over, till they hit him one way or other, All theſe, with many other that might be adduced, cry aloud, how fain (as we ſay) they would pick a hole in his Blanket; whereas true</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>yea</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity <hi>it ſelf enclines rather to hide the Imperfections and Blemiſhes of our Neighbour, than thus to blaze and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Particular Anſwers.</hi> Tho' we could eaſily with one ſingle ſtroke cut off the Heads of all theſe 17 Giant-like <hi>Monſters,</hi> by ſaying, They are meer <hi>Chimera</hi>'s, that is abominable Fictions, croſs Lyes and Calumnie, except ſome few things, that are moſt legal and juſt in themſelves: yet to ſatisfie thoſe, who are of a leſſer capacity; or, that are not acquainted with the true Circumſtances of things, we ſhall give you a ſhort hint at each of them. <hi>To the firſt Article,</hi> he anſwers; 'Tis both falſe and abſurd. In a word; 'tis a moſt malicious and baſe Calumny, to ſay that the School is under a great Decay, and almoſt broken for the Reaſons here mentioned. 'Tis alſo moſt abſurd not only in the Libellers to charge Mr. K. therewith, but alſo in the Judges to liſten to them in ſuch a matter; there never having been any previous <hi>Viſitation</hi> (as Law, Reaſon and Cuſtom require) upon that head; nor any kind of Trial made about his Knowledge, Diligence, Attendance, or what other thing relates to his Office. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſpeaking one day in face of Synod upon this head. Mr. <hi>Borleans,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Bedrule,</hi> roſe up, and ſpoke thus, at leaſt to this purpoſe. <hi>M.</hi> ſaid he, Mr. <hi>K in this matter is in the right: The method we have taken is indeed prepoſterous and backward, as if we were driving the Plough before the Oxen,</hi> &amp;c.

In other terms, we humbly conceive, that neither the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> nor yet the Provincial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pray miſtake us not; there are yet many of them that <hi>never bow'd to Baal</hi> in this matter: yea, as to the Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> knows none. But, ſhall we tell you the true Cauſes or Reaſons why the School is under a decay? If you knew things, and conſidered them aright with all their Circumſtances, you would wonder, that 'tis not in a much worſe Caſe than tis. In ſhort therefore know, that Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and his Elders have taken all means and methods imaginable utterly to ruine it. 1. He has diſpers'd Letters through the Kingdom, wherein he repreſents Mr. <hi>K.</hi> the vileſt Wretch under the Sun: a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36252:57"/>
Man, he writes, <hi>destitute of Mother-wit; deſtitute of Grace; of corrupt Principles, corrupt Morals,</hi> &amp;c And you may be ſure, ſince he takes ſuch freedom with his Pen, he will by no means ſpare to ſhew out the like Venom with his Tongue upon all Occaſions. Yea, in the very Pulpit on the Lord's Day, not only in his Sermons and Diſcourſes to a Congregation of 2 or 3000 People together, but even in the publick Prayers of the Church, he belcheth out to God himſelf moſt horrid, moſt dreadful, and moſt malicious Expreſſions; as you ſhall hear in their proper place. Expreſſions, we ſay, deſign'd on purpoſe not only to diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ade, but to affright and terrifie Silly, Simple, Poor, Ignorant Souls from putting their Children to Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s School. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. <hi>Part.</hi> 5. 2. He and his Elders, forſooth, by themſelves, without the concurrence of one ſingle Heretor, erected another <hi>Grammar</hi> School in the place; and uſed all means poſſible to carry away Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Scholars to it. Of this School and its Maſter, you will have an account in the following Part. 3. They made the Report to go up and down the whole Country, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was certainly within ſome few Days or Weeks to be turn'd out with diſgrace; ſo that people thought it a great folly to ſend their Children to him. Hence for 2 years and more, ſcarcely ſo much as one Scholar came to his School. 4. To be good Examples to others (we have juſt reaſon to think by Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s Inſtigation) the 3. Miniſters of the Preſbytery, who had two of them their Sons, and one his Brother with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> took them away, which made others to do the like; and you may be ſure would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many to put their Children, or Relations to his School. Laſtly, think you not, but theſe baſe, lying, malicious Libels have done much hurt of this kind, eſpecially amongſt People that are not well inform'd in Matters, and are not acquainted with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Now, to conclude: Let any indifferent Perſon ſeriouſly conſider the Matter, and he ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is not only a moſt unreaſonable and abſurd thing; but a mighty wicked and malicious Act in Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and his Elders, firſt to do what lay in their power to break Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s School; and then to ſtage him as the Cauſe of it. 'Tis truly ſuch a notorious wickedneſs in them, that we know neither what name to give it, nor what to compare it with. In a word; 'tis a <hi>Complex</hi> Wickedneſs, not very unlike as if 5 or 6 lewd Fellows ſhould in the night-time, break into their Neighbour's Houſe, and not only plunder and pillage it, but even beat and wound ſome of the Family, and murder others. And the next day one of theſe wicked Villains informs againſt ſome honeſt Perſon, as guilty of the ſaid Villany: Others of them ſtand not to ſwear it was ſo; and may be, ſome ſit with the Judges, and give out Sentence. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>He anſwers that his Entry was moſt legal, having a formal Call from all concern'd: which Call was duly intimated by the Bailyff of the Place, in the name of the Earl and others, firſt to the Elders (there being no Miniſter at that time) next to the Presbytery. Nor did either of theſe make the leaſt ſhew of any Objection of this nature. An account of this you have,</hi> Sect. 4, 5, &amp;c. Part 1. <hi>to which we refer you. As to the Act here mentioned,</hi> 7 Feb 1645, Mr K. <hi>ſtill was, and yet is ready to be try'd by any Church Judicature in</hi> Scotland, <hi>in relation to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the ſaid Act. And certainly you will readily acknowledge, that it was not very proper for him to preſs the Members of Presbytery to try him. All of them knew very well, he was past a</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, <hi>and ſufficiently qualified that way, having given many Proofs of his Skill in that Art. And to confirm this, and all other Clauſes of that nature, they did ſo far approve his Call, that</hi> 4 <hi>of</hi> 6 <hi>(there being no more in the Presbytery for the time) put their Sons, Brethren or Friends to his School. As to the Act of Parliament here cited, which they ſay makes againſt his way of Entry. A moſt wonderful and monſtrous Act indeed! Pray, what in Nature can be more abſurd, than to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that a</hi> Non-ens, <hi>a meer</hi> Nothing <hi>ſhould ſtart up and worry a Man? Mr.</hi> K. <hi>entred School-Maſter,</hi> 16 May, 1692. <hi>How then can an Act, which had no</hi> Being <hi>till the</hi> 12 <hi>of</hi> June 1693, <hi>do him hurt? <hi>Art.</hi>
                     </hi> 3. <hi>We have ſaid too too much already on this Point.</hi> Sect. 7. P. 3. Anſwer <hi>to the</hi> Article. <hi>As alſo it comes in again,</hi> Sect. 28. Rem. 4. <hi>of this</hi> Part. <hi>There is here a very ſtrange Expreſſion, which we can't paſs without ſaying ſomething to it.</hi> There is cauſe to believe, <hi>ſay the Libellers,</hi> that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was very offenſive at <hi>Lithgo</hi> to all fearing God. <hi>If you ſound this Buſineſs to the bottom, you will find it the moſt Helliſh and dreadful Reflection, that ever a man charg'd his Neighbour with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A reflection indeed! A wonderful Reflection, not on Mr.</hi> K. <hi>only: but on thouſands of People in and about that Burgh; with whom he convers'd most familiarly and Neighbourly, without Offence, as to all appearance, they doing him many Acts of kindneſs, and he according to his power returning the like to them. So that you muſt of neceſſity infer from the words of the Libellers, that all thoſe thouſands of people, to whom he was not offenſive, were perſons not fearing God in the</hi> Belief <hi>of Mr.</hi> J. <hi>and his Elders. Will any other</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>think you, in the world ſubſcribe this Article of their Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:36252:57"/>'Tis a moſt dreadful Aſſertion, and a clear Demonſtration that they are altogether void of <hi>Charity,</hi> the chief of <hi>Christian</hi> Vertues, thus to condemn to Eternal flames (without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) ſo many thouſands of People; and that not only ſuch, as perhaps are of a different Perſuaſion from them in ſome things; but even theſe of their own Principles. To paſs all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, take this one ſingle Inſtance, which may well ſerve for ten thouſand. Dare you ſay that Mr. <hi>W. Tullidaf,</hi> one of the Chief Pillars of your Church, was a perſon, that did not fear God; and that at the very time, when he was lying Priſoner in <hi>Blackneſs</hi>-Caſtle for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to his Principles in matters of Religion? Now that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was not offenſive to him is evident from his Letter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. <hi>Part</hi> 2. And to give you a further Demonſtration of this Point, or an infallible ſign that Mr. <hi>Tullidaf</hi> was not offended at Mr <hi>K.</hi> either as to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or Morals; pray, connſider, that after he was relieved from Priſon, and the <hi>Scene</hi> of Affairs in this Kingdom quite alter'd, and he advanc'd to be Principal in the Univerſity of St. <hi>Andrew's;</hi> yea, and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> rabbl'd and thruſt out of his Charge, meerly on the Account of his <hi>Principles</hi> in matters of Church Government; yet that worthy perſon was ſo far from being offended at his Judgment in matters under debate, or his carriage otherwiſe, that he uſed all means he could to get him ſetled, as a Member of that Univerſity. Of which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you have an Account in that 15 <hi>Sect. Part</hi> 2. And further, if you conſider things aright, you will find this Expreſſion of the Libellers a terrible Reflection, not only on People in and about <hi>Lithgo,</hi> but generally through the whole Kingdom; for the Libellers can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was offenſive to Perſons there more than elſe where. He liv'd 6 Years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before he went to <hi>Lithgo</hi> in that Noble Famiiy of the E. of <hi>Kincardin,</hi> to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons of the greateſt Quality of the Nation did frequently reſort, and heard him twice a day perform Family-Worſhip. Now, if his carriage had been offenſive, would that Noble E who was a Perſon of great knowledge; and ſo could deſcern a fault as ſoon as any man, have ſuffered him to continue ſo long in his Family, and that in ſo Honourable a Station, as to be Teacher and Governour to his eldeſt Son? And if any ſhould doubt, whether or not, the E. was pleaſed with Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s carriage, he can produce Letters under his Lo. hand, while officiating as Secretary at <hi>London</hi> written to him, expreſly bearing that he was exceeding well pleaſed with it; and this his Lo. did write in ſo familiar and kind a manner, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did often bluſh to read them, ſome whereof he can yet produce. It might alſo be ask'd our Libellers, to whom Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was offenſive the two years he attended My Lord <hi>Bruce,</hi> Son to the ſaid E. at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Glaſcow;</hi> for thouſands in that Country came to know him during that time. Perhaps they'll tell you, Theſe were dark and cloudy days, days of Ignorance and blindneſs: days, when Sin and Iniquity did abound without Check; yea, ſcarcely ſo much as taken notice of. Now, bleſſed be God; 'tis otherwiſe. We have the bright Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel among us. We will not, yea, we dare not ſuffer ſin to paſs without its due puniſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To paſs therefore the 9 or 10 years he lived in the City of <hi>Eden.</hi> in the ſaid Dark and Cloudy Days, what will the Libellers ſay, as to the two years and a half he lived there, immediately before he came to <hi>Kelſo?</hi> Dare they ſay, that none of thoſe, he was not offenſive too there, do fear God? 'Tis a moſt horrid buſineſs, even to think it. Ay, they dare not only think it, and ſay it; but Subſcribe it; yea, They Believe it, as an Article of their <hi>Faith.</hi> O Dreadful! This is no leſs, than to avow, that the prime of our Nation, perſons of all ranks and degrees of either Sex, that live in, or reſort to that City, are altogether void of the fear or Grace of God. Pray, is the Reverend <hi>Doctor Rule,</hi> Principal of the College and one of the firſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of that City, in whoſe Pariſh Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his Family liv'd, and with whom he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and very familiarly converſed; Is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alſo void of the fear of God? Yes, yes, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any man; for he gave Mr. <hi>K.</hi> a Teſtimonial, ſhewing to all the World, that he was not offenſive to him; and you know that it is a <hi>Fundamental Article in the Libeller's Creed, that he was offenſive to all fearing God.</hi> That was in <hi>Lithgo,</hi> ſay they; not in <hi>Eden.</hi> By this means they make Mr. <hi>K</hi> like <hi>Proteus,</hi> who could turn himſelf into any ſhape. In the E. of <hi>Kincar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>'s Family he was good, in <hi>Lithgo</hi> wicked: in <hi>Eden.</hi> he became good again, but now in <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> he is worſe than ever. Methinks he ſhould return to <hi>Eden.</hi> and there die a good man. The laſt Remark we ſhall make here, is on the ſtrange way the Libellers word this part of their Article; <hi>There is,</hi> ſay they, <hi>cauſe to believe he was very offenſive to all fearing God.</hi> They do not, you ſee, pretend to have <hi>Knowledge</hi> in this matter; for that is ſimply impoſſible; and is too too weak a ground to rely on in a buſineſs of this kind. And therefore they have done wiſely in betaking themſelves to a third <hi>Fort, viz. Faith,</hi> which amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is no

thing ſhort of Knowledge, being a firm perſwaſion of a thing either by Divine Revelation, or Inſpiration: If they have it by Revelation, let them ſhew us Chapter and Verſe in the Word of God.

                  <p>MR. <hi>K.</hi> was exceeding perplex'd how to carry under his preſent <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> when he reflected on the whole Proceſs, and conſidered the way and manner of its procedure, with the many ſtrange and various <hi>Accidents,</hi> which occaſionally fell out almoſt at every Meeting. Hence things were ſo far from being like to be brought to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that they daily multiplied and encreaſed exceedingly. It was with him, as with <hi>Hercules,</hi> when he fought with the Serpent <hi>Hydra,</hi> which, they ſay, had 50. Heads; and when one was cut off, two ſtarted up in its room. At firſt he was charged only with 2 or 3. Crimes; next 15; and now with 17: ſo that he ſaw no end: but ſtill new Forces levied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and always the laſt more numerous than the former. But that, which vexed him worſt of all, was that he never once came to an open ſight on the Points of his Libel, being always attack'd by Surprize; nor was this his fault, but the Judges. In plain terms, they never heard him debate, nor reaſon Matters with his Adverſaries. Yea, his Judges, at leaſt a vaſt number of them, do not to this day underſtand the true ground of the Plea, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in general, nor as to this and the other Point. And this is not only, becauſe 'tis a very Intrigate and perplex'd Buſineſs, and now is become mighty tedious, conſiſting of hundreds of Points and Clauſes; but chiefly on the account, that there are daily coming in new Judges, Perſons altogether unacquainted with the Affair, every Synod receiving new <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents</hi> from places about, beſides ſeveral Miniſters lately planted in their own bounds, and always a good number of freſh and new elected ruling Elders; to ſay nothing of ſuch, both Miniſters and Elders, as were abſent at former Diets; and eſpecially on the conſideration of that, this Plea has been cognoſs'd in the Interval of Synods by Committees, frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſcarcely of the 20th part of the Synod. All theſe know very little of the Proceſs. Now when it comes in before a Synod, preſently 'tis put into the hands of a Committee: they make a Report by way of an <hi>Overture;</hi> immediately that goes to a Vote, ſo that the Body or f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r greateſt part of the Synod know little in the ſaid Affair. All ſuch muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity walk, as they are led, being little better than blind, and ſo are obliged to follow thoſe they moſt affect. Such certainly was Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Caſe in the late Synod (15 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1695.) <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> and <hi>Sub-Committees</hi> ſat days and nights, yet never once call'd for him, nor yet the Synod, till he was to hear his Sentence read. Theſe with many other Conſiderations, which we have not will to mention, mov'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to give the following brief Account of ſome few material Points of this Plea, which might be as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of the reſt, and perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke both Judges and Libellers to bring matters to a publick Debate. He knows very well, that Perſons concern'd in the other bide, will think he is too tart and bitter in his Expreſſions. But he hopes, and expects, that whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly conſider this whole Buſineſs, that he has juſt ground for for what he ſays, and that his words are no ways <hi>Hyperbolical;</hi> but rather come very far ſhort of what may be ſaid. And grant there be ſome few words, or Expreſſions exceeding the <hi>Subject;</hi> this is no new thing: the beſt of Writers uſe it, and are
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36252:59"/>
not blam'd ſor't. And yet, if you ſeriouſly ponder all <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and compare <hi>Words</hi> with <hi>Deeds;</hi> the <hi>Expreſſion</hi> with the <hi>Action,</hi> you ſhall find as little of that kind here, as any where elſe. Men, call'd to it ſhould ſpeak Truth: <hi>Black ought to be call'd black; white white.</hi> You know very well, that the Spirit of God tells, <hi>That he, who juſtifieth the wicked; and he, that condemneth the Juſt, even they both are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 17.15. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> has this to ſay for himſelf, that he has been exceedingly oppreſs'd by Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and others many ways. We need not be particular; the thing is ſo obvious, that he, who runs, may read: and you know the common Saying, <hi>Oppreſſion makes a wiſe Man-mad.</hi> Pray, conſider, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and unreaſonable it is, to blame a Man for relating matters of <hi>Fact</hi> in his, own defence, and paſs others, who forge Lyes and Calumnies to diſgrace him. We need not again put you in mind of that helliſh Calumny about the Woman in <hi>Blakader,</hi> nor of that abominable and curſed <hi>Miſſive,</hi> which Mr. <hi>J.</hi> ſent through the whole Kingdom (we may ſay) ſhewing to the World, that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is void <hi>of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. Nor how in another Paper, he calls him; <hi>The Devils Agent; Factor for Hell,</hi> &amp;c. Of which you ſhall have a Touch, <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. We have prefac'd too long.

Mr.</hi> K. <hi>in his</hi> Defences <hi>to the ſaid</hi> Libel <hi>deſir'd of the Committee to know, by what warrant they took on them to cognoſce any other thing than what was ſtated before the Synod and recommended to them by that Judicature; otherwiſe, ſaid he, it were to bring in things</hi> per Saltum, <hi>beſides many other evils, that follow thereon. And therefore he thought not himſelf obliged to anſwer to any new</hi> Article, <hi>till either he was aſſail'd from, or condemn'd for the ſaid Crimes, as appears in his</hi> Defences <hi>and</hi> Inſtruments; <hi>eſpecally, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that many of the things contain'd in that new</hi> Libel <hi>were Civil Matters, and therefore fell not under the Inſpection of a Church Judicature. Notwithſtanding theſe and many others moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and convincing Arguments the Committee went or to proſecute the Buſineſs in a most illegal manner, which made</hi> Mr. K. <hi>and theſe commiſſionated from the E. of</hi> R. <hi>to appeal from them to the then next enſuing Synod in matters</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>and to the Judge ordinary in matters</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>craving conform to Law,</hi> 10 <hi>days to give in their Reaſons of Appeal, which accordingly was done. Notwithſtanding this Appeal, the Committee proceeds and examines Witneſſes, not waiting till they ſaw, whether or not there might be given in ſuch convincing Reaſons, as ought to be of ſufficient force to put a ſtop to their procedure, being, it ſeems, reſolved to paſs on in ſpite of Law and Reaſon. <hi>Paragr.</hi>

Theſe ſtrange Changes of Bodies in <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Works are as nothing in Compare of what was to be ſeen here. Yea, <hi>Proteus,</hi> who, they ſay, could turn himſelf into any <hi>Form,</hi> ſometimes appearing like <hi>Fire,</hi> ſometimes like <hi>Water;</hi> yet did it not ſo nimbly and eaſily, as theſe we ſpeak of Saw you not juſt now, how one ſitting <hi>Clerk</hi> turn'd himſelf in a trice to a <hi>Witneſs:</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Thomſon,</hi> ſaid he, as <hi>Clerk; Here I'm,</hi> ſaid he again, as <hi>Witneſs.</hi> Was not this nimbly done, and with great eaſe; only by hitching himſelf a little off the Seat, and ſomewhat altering his tone, and 'twas done. 'Tis true; he was at ſome more pains, and it coſt him more time alſo to come off the Bench and perform the reſt of the duties of a Witneſs. <hi>Come, Brother,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> ſaid his fellow Witneſs; <hi>and depone you, and I ſhall be Clerk. Come you alſo, Brother,</hi> Mr <hi>Gaudy,</hi> ſaid another Witneſs, <hi>and I'le Moderate in the mean while,</hi> &amp;c. And thus were they <hi>transformed</hi> ſometimes into one ſhape, ſometimes into another; like <hi>Hodg-Podg</hi> or a <hi>ſtrange Confuſion,</hi> of Creatures, <hi>Mingled mangled</hi> through one another. There were, we told you, 6 Members in whole, 5 of the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Couden</hi> in <hi>Duns;</hi> 4 of the 5 were <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> yet ſat <hi>Judges,</hi> and Voted that they themſelves ſhould <hi>ſwear</hi> and <hi>depone,</hi> and that after an Appeal, Pray, are not theſe <hi>

Mr. K. <hi>muſt here in the firſt place thankfully acknowledge, that this Synod took exceeding great pains to bring things to a Concluſion; and ſome Gentlemen of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with not a few of the Brethren did what in them lay to carry matters to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Accommodation. Near three days were ſpent by the Synod, Committees, and Sub-committees in that Affair. Days! Yea, rather Nights and Days; for twice they ſat, till about</hi> 12 <hi>a Clock at Night. Yet</hi> Mr. K. <hi>muſt be pardoned, if he take the Liberty to tell, that the ſaid Judicature was guilty of great</hi> Failings. <hi>They conſidered indeed the whole</hi> Proceſs; <hi>The</hi> Libel, <hi>Mr.</hi> K's Defences; <hi>The</hi> Remarks <hi>of the Libellers on the ſaid</hi> Defences; <hi>The Depoſitions of the Witneſſes with ſeveral other Papers; and yet never ſo much as once all that while called for Mr.</hi> K. <hi>to hear what he had to object, either againſt the Witneſſes themſelves, or their Depoſitions, He had not objected againſt them, before they depon'd, not being preſent to bear; nor any for him; nor</hi> Neuters <hi>permitted to enter, doors being kept full. And tho' he has once and again, and that by way of Inſtrument required to ſee the</hi> Depoſitions; <hi>yet to this minute his just deſire is deny'd him, albeit there be an expreſs Act of</hi> Parliament <hi>in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</hi> Paragr. 7. 1. <hi>Who knows, but Mr.</hi> K. <hi>may inſtruct that he was</hi> Alibi, <hi>when he ſhould have done, or ſaid ſuch or ſuch things, depon'd by the Witneſſes?</hi> 2. <hi>'Tis moſt certain, that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Relation, or an Account of the Circumſtances of a buſineſs does very often take off the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>te and edge of an Argument, otherwiſe ſeeming very pungent. This will be found to be Mr.</hi> K<hi>'s Caſe in many Points.</hi> 3. <hi>Is it not a very common thing, that Words and Sentences be ſometimes miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and miſconſtrued, even by the Learnedſt of Men, till perſons more nearly concerned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Circumſtances, or rather the Author himſelf give the true ſenſe and meaning thereof That this makes for Mr.</hi> K. <hi>can be demonſtrated, when require'd. And therefore it was, that ſome Worthy Gentlemen in that Synod, when a debate aroſe about the Senſe of ſome words in his Printed</hi> Information <hi>about the Plea he had with the Town-Councel of</hi> Lithgo, <hi>deſired Mr.</hi> K. <hi>might be call'd, who beſt knew the meaning; but that juſtice was deny'd him. Should Mr.</hi> J. <hi>meet with the like uſage for many Expreſſions uttered by him in the Chair of</hi> Verity, <hi>before thouſands of People, a black (A) Doom would paſs upon him. His words at the firſt look ſeem to have a moſt fearful, and grim Aſpect; but after that he puts his Gloſs on them, and gives an account of Circumſtances, the words become abundantly (B) ſmooth, and no ways Antichriſtian, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable. The Expreſſions are,</hi> That a Scociety of People, Epiſcopally Inclin'd were a Communion of Devils, and a Company of Prophane Men and Women: <hi>and this ſaid, even when they were going about the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Item,</hi> That all their Teachers are Soul-Murderers, <hi>(C) with many others of that Nature. Rem. (A) A black Doom will paſs,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>Certainly he would he Condemned;</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> alluding to the antient cuſtom of People, who, ſitting Judges, put into a little Box a black Bean, when they Condemned any Perſon; and they who were for affoiling him put in a white Bean. <hi>(B)</hi> When a Perſon of Honour ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Semple</hi> about theſe Expreſſions of Mr. <hi>J.</hi> He anſwered that, when the Brethren were going to rebuke
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36252:60"/>
him for them, he put a ſuch a Gloſs on them they were ſatisfied with it. If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had met with the like Favour; or rather juſtice, 'tis more than probable, that he would have ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them alſo. <hi>(C)</hi> take this one for all. When by Act of Parliament the Epiſcopal Clergy were Prohibit to Baptize or Marry, ſome perſons in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> who formerly were of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Communion, did go to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> deſiring him to Baptize their Children, who cauſed them Solemnly engage before the whole Congregation that they ſhould never again go to that Schiſmatical Meeting-Houſe, nor hear any Epiſcopal Miniſter Preach. Others there were who had no freedom to have their Children Baptized by him, and finding a difficulty to get an Epiſcopal Miniſter, ſent for one from <hi>England</hi> to adminiſter that Sacrament. The next Sunday after Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Baptizing a Child in the Church, took occaſion to inveigh bitterly againſt it; ſaying, there were ſome rather than bring their Children to the Houſe of God, to be Baptized, <hi>would rather ſend for a man out of another Nation, and Sacrifice their firſt-born to</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch. Paragr. 8. <hi>Hence did ariſe another very great failing, in that Judicature,</hi> viz. That they paſs'd Sentence againſt <hi>Mr. K.</hi> not being heard, <hi>by judging him unfit to be Seſſion-Clerk or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor; and that after a ſerious Conſideration (ſaith the Sentence) of the Complex Affair of his Proceſs. Whereas, if he had received according to the Practiſe, and Law of this Kingdom an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of his Proceſs, parcicularly of the Depoſitions of the Witneſses, and had been permitted to object againſt the illegal procedure of his Judges and the Witneſſes, and their Depoſitions; certainly the ſaid Complex Affair, would have appeared with a far different aſpect; eſpecially conſidering, there were many Members of that Synod, who were not preſent at the former, and conſequently knew not the true state of matters. But mainly in regard the whole Scene of things was quite altered; and a new</hi> Libel <hi>raiſed and receiv'd in by the intervening Committee, contrary to any power given them by their</hi> Conſtituents, <hi>the former Synod. And if the Laws not only allow that all alledged guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtand by the Judge, and hear every word the Witneſses depone againſt them; but alſo expreſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that the Clerk of whatſoever Judicature in the Kingdom, he obliged to give, and that</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>to the ſaid alledged guilty perſons, Copies of the Depoſitions before adviſing. How much more ought Mr.</hi> K. <hi>to have had the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes led againſt him, in regard he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when they depon'd and were examined by the abovementioned ſtrange kind of Judicature, made up of one Aſſiſtant, and a Presbytery conſiſting of one ſingle perſon; on which ſandy Foundation the whole Structure is built.</hi> Paragr. 9. <hi>A third failing, and that a very conſiderable one, is, that the Sentence of the Synod is without any Reaſon; or</hi> Becauſe, <hi>as if the Judgement and Will of that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature were ſufficient to make a Law.</hi> Paragr. 10. <hi>A fourth is, that after ſo narrow an Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Search has been made into this buſineſs, as hardly the like has been in our Age, yet after all Mr.</hi> K. <hi>muſt ſtill lie under the ſtain of ſo many groſs Crimes, and be kept from the Profits of theſe Offices to which he has right. Either there was ground for a Sentence to condemn him, or to aſsoil him. If the former; why did not Sentence paſs against him? If the latter, why was he not aſſoild? That there was not ground, is now evidently manifeſt to all the World; otherwiſe, why is a new</hi> Libel <hi>raiſed? Why more Witneſses ſummoned? Why the old re-examined? Can another Reaſon under the Sun be given, but that they have Succumb in their probation of the former Libel? And why Succumb? Certainly, 'tis not, becauſe the Judges were not their friends, for ſome of them have been too too favourable to them. Nor it is for want of Witneſses; for they had abundance of them: Mr.</hi> K. <hi>received</hi> Liſts <hi>of above forty; and beſides theſe (which is a very great iniquity) they Summoned and Examined more than were in his</hi> Liſts. <hi>Neither, becauſe the Witneſses were not</hi> habile, <hi>or fit to do that, which was required of them. No certainly, for better they could not have had in the whole World, They are ſuch, as cannot, but know Mr.</hi> K<hi>'s failings, if he be guilty of any in the view of Man. His own Domeſtick Servants, who ſee his carriage night and day depon'd againſt him. His Tablers, and others his Scholars. The Pedagogues, and Doctors of his School, with whom he converſed every day moſt Familiarly; to mention no more. Laſtly, it is near an Impoſſibility it can be on the account, that a ſtrict enough Method, or way of Examining the Witneſſes was not taken; for both Lawful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful means were uſed in the matter. They were not diſturbed with Spectators in the Action; for contrary to Law, it was done with cloſe doors; and all that might carry away their failings, ſhut out. Several Witneſſes, were ſuffered to ſtay within, when others depon'd; ſome lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked within the Church. One of the Accuſers cry'd out with a loud voice, while the Witneſs was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctating his Depoſitions, (A)</hi> Remember the Green-Bray-ſide, <hi>which infallibly implies, that that Witneſs had Communicated his mind to him before. Yea, the very Judge himſelf told the preſent</hi> Deponent, <hi>that the</hi> Prior <hi>Witneſs confeſs'd ſuch a particular about the Six Senſes.

Paragr. 11. <hi>A far ſhorter, and much ſurer way might have been taken; either by the Libellers or Judges, to know what ſort of a man Mr.</hi> K. <hi>is; whether, as to</hi> Manners, his Life and Converſation, his Humour and Temper of Spirit, his way of living with his Neighbours, his Judgment and Opinion of things; or what elſe concerns one man to know of another. <hi>There is a very Worthy perſon, a Grave, Prudent, Knowing and Learned man; and, which is beſt of all, (as far as one Man can ſee into another) a Pious and Godly</hi> Chriſtian; <hi>one of your own Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; one, whom moſt of you know to be ſuch, Mr.</hi> Geo.

During all the ſaid time there was never the leaſt appearance of any</hi> Jar <hi>imaginable, never an angry word, or wrong look between them. Now, let Mr.</hi> J. <hi>and Mr.</hi> Mullighen <hi>be put each in a Ballance, ſuppoſing them equally good and knowing men; and then judge, whoſe</hi> Verdict; <hi>or</hi> Teſtimony <hi>deſerves the greater</hi> Credit. <hi>The one ſpeaks what he knows; the other by</hi> Hear-ſay <hi>only, and as he is informed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he knows not.

                     </gap>r of Spirit, as they repreſent to the World, may evidently appear from his 8 years living with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Mullinghen</hi> in ſo great Peace and Harmony, that there never hapned, ſo much as once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them the leaſt ſhew of any debate. Perhaps you'll ſay, this flow'd from Mr. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghen</hi>'s calm Nature: and not from Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s. We deſir'd you to ask Mr. <hi>Mullinghen,</hi> what ſort of a Man Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is. If he be ſuch, as Mr. J. and his Elders ſay he is, certainly Mr. <hi>Mull.</hi> could not be ignorant of it, either as Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s carriage to himſelf, or others: He would ſee or hear of it. But that we may put this Buſineſs beyond all doubt; Mr. <hi>K.</hi> not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to Mr. M. but to all that ever were Teachers with him in his School. 'Tis like, he can ſay, what few, or perhaps no Maſters in <hi>Scotland</hi> dare do, that in his life he never had any debate with thoſe that were Doctors in his School. The truth of this aſſertion he leaves to be atteſted by many thouſands, who have been his Scholars; let them declare, if they can, that ever they ſaw the leaſt ſhadow or appearance of diſcord. And ſhall the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mr. K's Adverſaries be preferr'd to that of many thouſands of indifferent perſons? But Mr. K needs not be much mov'd with what they ſay, conſidering that they treat the noble <hi>E</hi> of <hi>R.</hi> and his Lo. moſt honourable Curators after the ſame manner, by accuſing them of the hight of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity.</hi> Article 5 of the ſaid Libel. Of, which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter. <hi>Paragr.</hi> 12. The fifth Eſcape, or failing in that Synod is that, tho' Mr. K. in his Reaſons of Appeal from the Committee to the Synod, did evidently ſhew that he had met with great injuſtice from the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> yet that Preſbytery, at leaſt many of them were continu'd to be his Judges in the Committee, and others acted as Proctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, particularly Mr <hi>Glen</hi> in <hi>Stitchel.</hi> And therefore he thinks fit here to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſon, which certainly may convince all the World that the Preſbytery, of <hi>Kelſo</hi> can't be Judges in this preſent debate between the Kirk-Seſſion there and Mr. <hi>K.</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Parties,</hi> and highly concern'd in the matter, both as to <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Intereſt;</hi> and therefore can't but run along with the ſaid Kirk-Seſſion; yea, they are more concern'd on many accounts, than the other. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did never before this time adduce this Argument, but now being neceſſitated to defend his own Reputation and Intereſt, he muſt be pardon'd, if he uſe all lawful means for that end, He will not ſay that the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo</hi> had a Prejudice at; tho' perhaps now they may: but certain it is they mightily are <hi>byaſsed</hi> in the preſent debate. For the better underſtanding this ſo material and neceſſary a Point, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to know, that the riſe and occaſion of this Conteſt between the Kirk-Seſſion and Mr. K. is about the <hi>Profits, Caſualties</hi> and <hi>Peraniſits</hi> belonging to the Offices of Seſſion-Clerk and Precentor or Reader; to which Profits Mr. K. lays claim by vertue of his Call and Contract ſubſcribed by the E. of <hi>R.</hi> and others concern'd: which call and contract is founded on the uninterrupted Cuſtom and Conſtitution of the place paff memory of any man living. The Members of the ſaid Preſbytery in time of vacancy coming to ſupply that Church did by eating and drinking in the houſe of J. <hi>Dun.</hi> Fewer in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> ſpend and conſume the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and paſs'd an Act, ordaining the Elders, or ſome of them to collect the ſame, for what uſe, the Act it ſelf will declare. If for the uſe of the Poor (as ſome ſay) then the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpent the Poors Money, and the Poor Mr. K's which is worſe than the other. Mr. K. did take Inſtruments againſt <hi>W. C.</hi> Collector of and Intromettor with the ſaid <hi>Dues</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> that he and his <hi>Conſtituents</hi> ſhould be liable to refound the ſame to him. Now is not the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> who are the <hi>Conſtituents,</hi> very much concern'd to defend their own Act and Actings in the Matter? And if the Elders ſhall be found oblig'd to be countable, to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> for their Intromiſſions ſeems it not very rational that the Preſbytery, who by their Act ordain'd the Elders to collect the ſaid Profits, ſhall be liable to ſatisfie them? So that 'tis the great Concern of the Preſbytery, both as to <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> to oppoſe Mr. K. in the Action under debate; and by an infallible Conſequence they are moſt incompetent Judges in this Proceſs, being ſo ſtrongly byaſſed. <hi>Papagr.</hi> 13. A ſixth Injury done to Mr. K. by that Synod, is, that they poſitively refus'd to give him the Extract of the Proceſs,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36252:62"/>
ſome of the Articles of the Libel being founded on Papers in their hands, 'tis ſimply impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he can purge himſelf without the production of the ſaid Papers. And the Inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ry is ſo much the greater, that there is an expreſs Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ordaining the Clerks of what Judicature ſoever to give, and that <hi>gratis,</hi> the Doubles or <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was a very ſtrange Anſwer, which the Synod gave to Mr. K. when he and others requir'd an Extract. <hi>They could not give any Extract,</hi> ſaid the Synod, <hi>till the Cauſe was concluded,</hi> as Inſtruments bear. What is this, pray but to give at him (as we ſay) a <hi>Candle,</hi> after he's dead? 'Tis <hi>gratis dictum</hi> here to pretend, that the Judicatures of the Church are not liable to civil Laws. Whatever may be ſaid in other caſes, there is not the leaſt ſhadow of Reaſon in this under debate. But on the contrary, the <hi>Church</hi> ought rather to be more for it, than the <hi>State,</hi> and readier to allow the alledged guilty Perſon all the means and methods he can in Reaſon deſire for cleaning himſelf from the pretended guilt, if he can; eſpecially, when there is no <hi>Canon,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Law</hi> to the contrary. And further the <hi>Church</hi> lays claim to civil Laws, when they make for them, and why may not others alſo have the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and benefit, when it ſuits their Caſe, and is in it ſelf moſt agreeable to Reaſon? And beſides, the Church obſerves the other particulars mention'd in that Act of Parliament, and why not this under debate? Let a reaſon be given. Laſtly, 'tis a <hi>Maxim</hi> in Law, <hi>vbi Lex non diſtinguis, nec nobis diſtinguendum.</hi> The Act of Parliament is general, and therefore Mr. K. craves the benefit thereof. <hi>Parage.</hi> 14. A ſeventh very remarkable Eſcape in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod is, that they did drive the <hi>Plough</hi> before the <hi>Oxen</hi> by declaring Mr K. unfit for the ſaid Offices, and yet not condemn'd for any fault; for the Sentence mentions none only ſeems ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to imply ſome ſuch thing; but like the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Delphus,</hi> leaves people to conjecture what it is. In effect, and by infallible Conſequence, the buſineſs is a plain <hi>Hyſteron-Proteron,</hi> a <hi>Monster</hi> in Nature, where the Effect precedeth the Cauſe. He ought firſt to have been found guilty of ſome Crime or fault deſerving Deprivation before he could be laid aſide. 'tis a mighty prepoſterous Act, firſt to hang him, and thereafter to appoint a Committee to ſit on his Aſſize. <hi>Paragr.</hi> 15. An eight Error is, that ſuppoſing Mr. K. to be unfit for the ſaid Offices, yet the Method that is taken for ſupplying the ſame is moſt ſiniſtrous and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, in regard it encroacheth on the E. of <hi>R.</hi> and others their <hi>Right;</hi> for if the Perſon, whom his Lo. and others concern'd preſent, be not legally qualified, they ought to be advertiſed, in order to name another. 'Tis true, what the Synod did in that matter, is qualified, <hi>until,</hi> ſaith the Sentence, <hi>the School of</hi> Kelſo <hi>be provided with a qualified Doctor,</hi> &amp;c. The Synod here takes on them what's not in their power to do. This <hi>qualification</hi> razeth and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the antient Cuſtom and Conſtitution of the Place, and taketh away Mens civil Right and Property Mr. K. always was, and ſtill is willing that his Doctor ſupply his place in the performance of the ſaid Office, providing no perſons Right be thereby encroach'd upon. <hi>Paragr.</hi> 16. Laſtly, Mr. K. here ends, as he began with ſome thing very commendable in the ſaid Synod. They thought not fit themſelves to decide this Plea, but left it in the hands of ſome very honourable and worthy Gentlemen, My L. <hi>P.</hi> the L. <hi>M.</hi> Sir <hi>J. H.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, to whoſe determination Mr. <hi>K.</hi> would not fear to commit his very Life. But even here. <hi>Later anguis in herba.</hi> Pray, what the better is Mr. K. that he has a good ſtore of excellent Swords, if they be lock'd faſt within the Caſtle, when he ſtands in need of 'em? Not one of theſe fore nam'd Gentlemen, with many others, ever own'd the ſaid Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. And how could it be expected, that my L. <hi>P.</hi> or the L. <hi>M.</hi> would come off the Bench at <hi>Edenb.</hi> to ſit and cognoſte a pitiful Cauſe at <hi>Kelſo</hi> Had theſe Lords and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kept Diets, no queſtion things would have come to a good Concluſion. But how could they come to Diets? Some were not advertiſed, others ſhifted to have any hand in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which is evident, that of four Diets together, there was but once a <hi>Quorum. <hi>Paragr.</hi>

They heard all he had to ſay with great patience, nor were his Adverſaries ſuffer'd to ſpeak, at leaſt in Publick,

but when he was preſent. After ſome pretty warm debate before the the <hi>Committee of Bills,</hi> and its <hi>Sub-Committees,</hi> and a touch before the <hi>Committee of Overtures</hi> (for the Buſineſs went in thither alſo for Advice) Mr. K. tho' not without difficulty, gain'd his Point, and got the Cauſe carried in before the Aſſembly, Mr. <hi>J.</hi> oppoſing the thing as much as he could. The Aſſembly without any debate, referr'd it to the Commiſſion; the Commiſſion put into the hands of 8 or 9 very worthy, grave and judicious Gentlemen; who ſcarely being well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Buſineſs, did caſt it back again upon the Commiſſion, ſaying <hi>It was a tickliſh Point, they would meddle no more with it.</hi> And in truth it was no wonder they ſtartred, when they heard how the matter came in, and out of the Seſſion and Preſbytery, and into the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. A very ſtrange procedure indeed! And may juſtly amaze all that hear the ſame. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragr.</hi> 19. The Members of the Commiſſion being and (it ſeems) very curious to take a look of this <hi>Monſter,</hi> call'd in M. J. and Mr. K. and enquir'd at Mr. K. how the buſineſs came in before the Kirk-Seſſion, and what paſs'd there. Of which Mr. K. having given a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, 'twas further ask'd, how it came in before the Preſbytery, and what paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Judicature. <hi>I can't tell,</hi> reply'd Mr. K. I was never <hi>before that Judicature in my life. They did things without me; as if I had been no ways concern'd, was you not cited before them ſaid the M. Not as all,</hi> reply'd M. K. At which they were all exceedingly aſtoniſh'd. Then, and not till then, <hi>M. J.</hi> ſpoke, ſaying; <hi>I wonder how M. K. can ſay he was never before the Presbytery of</hi> Kelſo; <hi>whereas he was frequently before that judicature. Pray,</hi> M. anſwer'd M. K. <hi>Let me have liberty to give a Return to what M. J. has laid to my charge. By what he ſaith, I'm guilty, not only of a moſt groſs falſe-hood; but of a horrid and damnable Lye: for, if I was frequently before the Presbytery, no question, but I know, I was; eſpecially being ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the matter. I again repeat my words, I was never ſo much as once before the Presbytery of Kelſo, nor ever cited, or defin'd: or call'd in before that judicature. What M. J. ſaith is nothing to the purpoſe being neither</hi> Ad-Irleminon Eodem tempore <hi>That judicature he means, is a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, made up of the Presbytery of</hi> Kelſo, <hi>and ſo many Aſſiſtants, appointed by the Synod to fit on</hi> M. Ks. <hi>Affair, Now this is not the Presbytery of</hi> Kelſo <hi>for a Mare and a Foal is not a Mare, Nor had this judicature a Being at that time but was afterwards appointed by the Synod. In ſhort,</hi> ſaid M. K <hi>I was not before that judicature; to which the Kirk-Seſsion of</hi> Kelſo <hi>made their Reference. So that, if</hi> M. J. <hi>mean not the ſaid judicature to which the References was made, what he ſaith, is altogether impertinent, and makes nothing to the preſent purpoſe.</hi> Now, whoſoever ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this paſſage, will certainly find that M. J. was not only guilty of a groſs impertinency; but of ſpeaking that, which is a manifeſt falſhood, if not a moſt horrid and malicious lye. And, if M. K. had not been preſent to anſwer for himſelf, it could not but have paſſ'd for a certain Truth.</p>

That's the oddeſt paſſage of all,</hi> reply'd Mr. <hi>K. The Presbytery having conſidered and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſc'd the affair, referr'd is to the Synod, that was to fit within eight days; but had no mind, as the event proved, to carry it before that Judicature; or if they had a mind, they deſign'd that that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature ſhould follow their foot-ſteps, by paſſing Sentence on a perſon unheard; for queſtionleſs, if they had reſolved to have proſecuted the buſineſs legally, they would have order'd Mr.</hi> K. <hi>to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear before the Synod. And therefore he himſelf was Neceſſitated to give in a Petition, ſhewing what Injuſtice he had met with from the Kirk-Seſſion and Presbytery, and deſired that the Reccords of both theſe Judicatures might be produced, as the ſaid</hi> Petition <hi>at more length bears.</hi> While Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was thus going on in giving an account of matters, one of the Members of the Commiſſion ſaith, <hi>What are we doing?

In ſhort, the Appeal was found to be faulty, partly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Clerk of the Synod, his not giving Mr. <hi>K.</hi> the Extract of a Proteſtation in the words in which it was taken, as by the ſame Inſtrument taken in a publick Notar's hand can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; partly by an <hi>(A)</hi> Omiſſion in Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s ſelf, and ſo the Proceſs returned back again where it was.</p>

In plain terms, Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s Accuſers had rais'd a new ſecond Libel, quite Cancelling and Deſtroying many Articles in the Old, and putting a New Face, or Dreſs on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as alſo adding a good number of things not heard of before, and preſented the ſame by a Petiton to the Committee, that was appointed by the late Synod to ſit on the former Libel. The Committee received in the ſaid new Libel; and paſſed Sentence thereon, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the matter to the Conſideration of this Reverend Synod. Whereas the ſaid Petition with its Libel ought to have been rejected and thrown over Bar, as a thing without the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their Power to Cognoſce, it not being recommended to them by the late Synod to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in any new Accuſation, but only to conſider the Contents of the former Libel, as the Sentence of the ſaid Synod bears.

                  <p>THe day following Mr. <hi>K</hi> being called before the Synod, the abovementioned Libel given in by the Elders is read in his preſence before a vaſt number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beſides Members; which being done, ſome of the Miniſters, and Ruling Elders deſired that his Anſwer ſhould be read alſo; others were poſitively againſt it, ſaying, that it was a paper full of Reflections againſt the Synod, and other Judicatures of the Church. <hi>They are not Reflections,</hi> anſwered Mr. <hi>K. but a true Relation of matters of Fact.</hi> The Members eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that had not been on the Committee, and only had heard that there were many very Strange Paſſages in the ſaid Paper, but knew not particulars, were preſſing it ſhould be read. Yea, ſome of the Spectators partly out of a Principle of Curioſity, partly of Juſtice, took the freedom to ſay pretty audibly, that it was moſt reaſonable it ſhould be read. After a long and warm debate, <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con; What,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>K. ſhall a baſe, lying, ſcandalous Libel be read in face of a Synod, and before ſome hundreds of People, that never once ſaw me in the face before this time, and I not permitted to give it anſwer? It ſeems you are reſolved to affront me. I

I have ſubſcribed every Page of that Paper, if it be ſuch as you alledge; you have the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of me.</hi> Mod. <hi>I crave it may be read; otherwſe, Ile proteſt againſt you.</hi> Then at length his deſire was granted. After this a Queſtion was moved, whether Mr. <hi>K.</hi> or another ſhould read it? Some, who had no will it ſhould be read at all, ſaid that Mr <hi>K.</hi> read too ſlowly; and the Paper was long, but in effect the reaſon was; becauſe Mr. <hi>K.</hi> read it too diſtinctly, and with too audible voice. After ſome debate amongſt the Brethren (for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> opened not his Mouth on this head) he was ordered to read it. He ſcarcely had read a Page or two when he was ſtopt, eſpecially by Mr. <hi>Anderſon. This Gentleman,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>K. is as unfit to be a Judge, as any I know; for he hates to be informed.</hi> The <hi>Mod.</hi> deſires Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to proceed. Within a little he is ſtopt again by Mr. <hi>J</hi> and others. Yea, the 3 and 4 time. At laſt he takes Money out of his Pocket, and lays it down on the Table, ſaying, If he was ſtopt again, he would proteſt againſt them, and ſo leave them. <hi>How come you,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>to write ſuch things, as are in that Paper? I muſt write,</hi> anſwered Mr. <hi>K. conform to the Subject. If you had given me better Matter, you ſhould have had better Diſcourſe. 'Tis not poſſible for any man to make a good thread of ſuch</hi> Naſty, Durty, Tatty, Tarry, Hairy Wool, <hi>as you have put into my hands.</hi> After a little jangling he was permitted to read it all over without further ſtop; yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many <hi>Gapes</hi> and <hi>Glowers, Spittings</hi> and <hi>Coughs;</hi> and not a little laughter of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not to name ſome of the Members. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> being removed and called in again, was told he behoved to wait on till the next day; which being come, and he called in, <hi>Your buſineſs,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Mod. is referred to a Committee, which is to ſit at</hi> Kelſo <hi>laſt Tueſday of</hi> May <hi>in order to ripen and prepare things for a Synod, which is to meet at</hi> Duns <hi>laſt Tuſeday of</hi> July <hi>next, which is to put an end to your Affair.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> tho' not a little diſpleas'd with continual <hi>Dilatures,</hi> and their making of him trip ſometimes <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> ſometimes <hi>East</hi> to Duns; yet was glad to hear they had now at length appointed a Synod, which was to put an end to ſo tedious and expenſive a <hi>Plea.</hi> And therefore ſaid he to the <hi>Mod. That things may be prepared ſo, as you ſay, I humbly crave an Extract of the Proceſs, particularly of the Depoſitions of witneſſes, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers, without which, 'tis ſimply impoſſible for me to purge my ſelf; and you know that the Laws and Practicks of this Kingdom allow that benefit to all Perſons in my Circumſtances.

                     </gap>d hard that an Extract ſhould be given; and on the Contrary, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> was tooth and nail againſt it. His great <hi>Achillian</hi> Argument (which in effect is no Argument, at moſt an <hi>In-artificial</hi> one) was, that the former Synod, had by a Vote refuſed an Extract, and ſo they could not now grant it. I hope, <hi>Mod.</hi> anſwered Mr. <hi>Orock,</hi> that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does not think the Synod Infallible. The Lords of Seſſion do often recall their own Sentence upon ſecond thoughts; and why may not we do the like? Some, as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was informed, were for giving an Extract, but not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Clerk, others motioned that he ſhould be ſuffered to ſee the Depoſitions and other Papers in the Clerks hand; but not get them into his Cuſtody: But neither of theſe two came to be debated. After a long Conteſt, it was carried by Vote of Synod to adhere to their former Sentence; and ſo to deny Mr <hi>K.</hi> all he deſired. Being called in, he was told the mind of the Synod: and therefore expecting no Juſtice from a Judicature, that deny'd him the ordinary and legal means, whereby alone he could purge himſelf from the Calumnies, he was Charged with, he Appeal'd from them in matters <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> to the next enſuing <hi>G: A.</hi> and in matters Civil to the Judge ordinary, as the ſaid Appeal and Inſtruments taken thereon at more length bear; which was likewiſe done by the Comniſſioner from the Earl. After Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was gone: <hi>Take up your Committee now,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Orock. I knew he would Appeal,</hi> anſwered Mr. <hi>J. before he came from</hi> Kelſo. <hi>However,</hi> reply'd Mr. <hi>O. we ought not give him occaſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is loath to be ſo poſitive, as to aver that Mr. <hi>J.</hi> made a Lye in face of Synod; if he affirmed ſo confidently, that he knew Mr. K. would Appeal before he came from <hi>Kelſo:</hi> If it be not a Lye, we ſay, truly it comes near to the borders of one, for it was not poſſible he could know it. Mr. K. indeed, certainly knows, that he had no deſign to Appeal, till he ſaw Injuſtice done him.</p>

For even after Appeal made from them to the Synod upon moſt rational and juſt grounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reaſons, as the ſaid Appeal at more length bears; Yet the Members of the ſaid Presbytery (who are all mightily byaſs'd in this Plea, both as to</hi> Credit <hi>and</hi> Intereſt, <hi>as is at large moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly made appear in that Paper called,</hi> A Brief Anſwer, <hi>&amp;c. given in by Mr.</hi> K. <hi>to the ſaid Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at</hi> Jedburgh, 21 April 96.) <hi>with one ſingle Aſſiſtant, Mr.</hi> Couden <hi>Miniſter at</hi> Duus, <hi>did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Examination of a Liſt of one and thirty Witneſſes (beſides theſe not in his List, which is a great Iniquity) whereof two only were deſigned, ſo that Mr.</hi> K. <hi>could not know, who they were he was to object againſt, there being</hi> 3, 4, <hi>or</hi> 5, <hi>of the ſame name in</hi> Kelſo, <hi>to paſs, who are in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: ſome of which Witneſses were</hi> Ultronious; <hi>ſome hugely poſſeſs'd with Prejudice, and greatly byaſs'd; ſome both Judge, Party and Witneſs; yea and Clerk too; many preſent at others Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſome interrupted by Fellow witneſſes, when deponing; and prompted by the very Judge to confeſs, by telling that the</hi> Prior-Witneſs <hi>confeſsed ſuch a particular.

Laſtly, to name no more, ſeveral Depoſitions not making for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers, are not minuted, And all this done with cloſe doors, contrary to an expreſs act of Parliament. This was the great day of Action, on whoſe ſandy Foundation is built the whole Fabrick of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Should all the particulars relating to this days work be here ſet down, the world might ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat. It look'd rather like a</hi> Stage-play, <hi>than a</hi> Meeting of Divines. <hi>There is a Touch of this in the ſaid</hi> Brief Anſwer. <hi>Now can any rational man expect Juſtice from perſons, guilty of ſo many groſs Eſcapes, as abovementioned.</hi> 5. <hi>This Provincial Synod in their former Meeting, not only proceeded illegally againſt</hi> Mr. K. <hi>as above; but did encroach upon the Property of the Earl of</hi> R. <hi>and other Heretors of the Pariſh of</hi> Kelſo, <hi>by Empowering the</hi> Kirk-Seſſion <hi>there to Act in, and preſent to the Offices belonging to</hi> Mr. K. <hi>and that in manifeſt contempt of Authority, and the ſaid Patrons their legal Right, and contrary to the antient Conſtitution and Cuſtom of the place, paſt memory of man. And, if Heretors by the preſent Conſtitution and Law of this Kingdom, have a hand, power or vote, in calling, or preſenting a</hi> Miniſter <hi>to their Church, much more a</hi> Precentor, <hi>or</hi> Seſſion-Clerk, <hi>who is to Record and put in Regiſter the</hi> Mariages <hi>and</hi> Baptiſms, <hi>which happen to be in their Pariſh; which buſineſs does rather concern Civil, than Eccleſiaſtical matters. All which being Conſidered, Juſtice in this</hi> Proceſs <hi>cannot be expected from this Synod.</hi> 6. <hi>This Synods</hi> Illegallity, Partiality, <hi>and</hi> Injuſtice, <hi>appears in their preſent meeting at</hi> Jedburgh, <hi>that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adher'd to their former Acts paſs'd in the former Synod and Meetings above-repreſented; but alſo, contrary to the practice of the Civilized</hi> Heathens, <hi>refuſed to give to the Defender the Names of the</hi> Informers, <hi>tho preſs'd thereto by way of</hi> Inſtrument; <hi>and tho it was urged that the ſame ought to be done, in reſpect theſe</hi> Informers <hi>might be Witneſſes againſt him.</hi> 7. <hi>This Synod contrary to the</hi> Municipal <hi>Law of this</hi> Kingdom; <hi>contrary to the minds and inclination of ſome of their</hi> Members. <hi>who appear to be most judicious among them, poſitively refuſed to give</hi> Mr. K <hi>an Extract or Double of the</hi> Proceſs, <hi>containing the</hi> Depoſitions <hi>of the Witneſses, tho' again and again preſs'd thereto; and tho is was known to them all, that there was a particular Article of the Libel againſt the Defender founded upon a Petition given into themſelves, and in their own hands; and tho' they Libel againſt the Defender upon that Petition; yet they refuſe to produce either the Principle, or give an Extract thereof. As alſo tho it be known to this Synod, that of all the Witneſſes, that were ſummoned, who were upwards of</hi> 40, <hi>yet</hi> Mr. K. <hi>heard none of theſe Examined, except three, his own two School-Doctors, and</hi> Andrew Robſon <hi>in the</hi> Floors, <hi>ſo that there is an Aſſolute neceſſity for the Defender to have an. Extract or Double of the Depoſitions of the Whole Witneſſes who were examined, ſeeing he was not preſent, when, nor knew what they deponed; for if he had been preſent, Lawful objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might have been given in againſt the Witneſses, and their Depoſitions, yet notwithſtanding this Synod poſitively refuſed to give Extracts thereof.</hi> 8. <hi>To ſuch hight of</hi> Partiality <hi>and</hi> Injuſtice <hi>ſome

of their judicatures are arriv'd, that they not only refuſe to give Extracts of paper in their hands; but alſo they diſcharge there Clerk to give the Defender the Extract of</hi> Inſtruments <hi>taken in his hands, tho upon moſt juſt ground againſt two of their own number: ſo that ſome times Mr.</hi> K. <hi>gets Extracts of his Proteſtations, but not in the words he takes them at; other times that benefit is poſitively deny'd him; as</hi> Inſtruments <hi>taken in a publick Notars hand can evidently make appear.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>the method and way taken to prove</hi> Mr. K. <hi>guilty of ſome horrid Crimes, is the moſt</hi> ſiniſtrous <hi>and</hi> back-ward <hi>courſe, that ever was heard of. An account of this you have</hi> Sect. 21, part 3. <hi>And therefore we ſhall not repeat things here. Only let no tell you, that</hi> Mr. Vetch. <hi>Miniſter at</hi> Weſtruther, <hi>one of them that ſhould have depon'd upon this head, was juſtly petted at this new Contrivance; and therefore poſitively refus'd to depone.</hi> Edgar of Whathelly, <hi>very wiſely follow'd Mr.</hi> Vetch, <hi>his own Paſtor's footſteps.</hi> Mr. K. <hi>has juſt ground to ſuſpect, that one of the Reaſons, why they refus'd him a Double of the Depoſitions, is, becauſe they have no will he ſhould ſee the many extravagant and wild things, that are in them; particularly the Depoſitions of thoſe, that were both judges and witneſſes at one time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all Which, <hi>this Synod, or any</hi> Member <hi>thereof are moſt incompetent judges in this Proceſs. And therefore</hi> Mr. K. <hi>appeals from this Provincial Synod to the next enſuing G. A of this National Church in ſo far as the matter is</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>and ſummons you the ſaid Provincial Synod, with the Libellers and all others concern'd,</hi> Apud Acts, <hi>to Appear before the ſaid G. A.</hi> when <hi>and</hi> where <hi>it ſhall happen the ſame to meet. And ſo far as the matter is</hi> Civil, <hi>he appeals to the judge ordinary. And thereupon the ſaid</hi> Mr. K. <hi>takes</hi> Inſtruments. <hi>To which appeal of the ſaid</hi> Mr. K <hi>Allex.</hi> Potts <hi>Commiſſioner from the E. of</hi> R. <hi>and his Lo.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A general Remark on the Reaſons of Appeal. You have here ſuch Reaſons, as</hi> Mr. K. <hi>had at the time; but if either</hi> Extracts <hi>of papers, as Law and Equity require, had been given him; or had he been allow'd to debate, and reaſon matters fairly with his Adverſaries before the judicatures; or yet had he then known the things, which</hi> Providentially <hi>are come to his ears ſince (tho he knows but yet a few) you ſhould have had both more Reaſons, and more convincing. But to ſupplie this want, at leaſt in part, you may take a review of matters form</hi> Sect. 8, <hi>to the end of the</hi> 3 <hi>Part.</hi>

                     <hi>STichel,</hi> 16 <hi>july.</hi> 96. It would be very tedious to give you a particular and full account of this paſſage, and all followed thereon. In ſhort; Know, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (no queſtion with the advice of his Brethren, whom he left at <hi>Ednim,</hi> where they were aſſiſting the Miniſter there at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper) went to <hi>Stichel,</hi> and told Sir J. P. that the Synod was to meet at <hi>Duns.</hi> 28 of the ſaid month, and wou'd certainly paſs a Sentence very unfavourable to Mr <hi>K.</hi> And therefore he deſir'd Sir <hi>J.</hi> who, he knew, had great Influence upon Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to adviſe him either to <hi>Dimit,</hi> or give in to the Synod a paper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with his hand, whereby he oblig'd himſelf to give the Synod full ſatisfaction; or that he ſhould leave to them to do in the Proceſs, as they thought fit. There was a third branch; but it came not in ſo early, nor ſo directly, as their two, viz. Or that he ſhould have the favour of the <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>R.</hi> to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Sir. J ſent an Expreſs for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and acquainted him with all that paſſ'd between them. Mr. K. poſitively refus'd to refer himſelf to the whole Synod; for he knew the temper of the moſt part. Yet he ſaid he wou'd refer himſelf to a ſelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: if they will permit him to name 20; he will leave to his adverſaries to chooſe 9. 11, or 17 of theſe to determine matters: which he thought as great a length, as in Reaſon they could deſire he ſhould go. Or, he offer'd thus; as he had done frequently, before: Let him chuſe any two Gentlemen he pleas'd; they other two; let theſe four take what <hi>Overs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> or <hi>Preſes</hi> they pleaſe, he promis'd to ſtand to their Determination. As to th' other point, he told Sir <hi>J.</hi> he wou'd not Dimit; <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>people will look on that, as of I acknowledg'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36252:66"/>
I were guilty of the crimes, I am charg'd with.</hi> Yet he added; If he ſaw any propability that there would be peace in the place, Goſpel-like, to have more ſucceſs by his Dimiſion, he wou'd very readily lay down his Charge. As to the third particular, (which came in oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely only) he ſaid it was a very unreaſonable <hi>Demand;</hi> and a moſt malicious act, or rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued tract and courſe of wickedneſs in Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and others, to carry as they did towards him upon any diſguſt between the Counteſs and Mr J. After a long diſcourſe upon theſe and other Heads, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> put a great many <hi>Queſtions</hi> to Sir <hi>John;</hi> ſuch as, <hi>Whether, or not, the Synod or Presbytery wou'd give him a Teſtimonial? And what kind of one it wou'd be?</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, Sir <hi>J. ſpoke nothing of that to me. What will they do with the Proceſs,</hi> continued <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>They will let it fall: there will never be more of it,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Sir</hi> J. <hi>If I be the man they call me,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>I think 'its a great fault in them to let me paſs ſo eaſily. They wou'd feign, it ſeems, be quit of you,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Sir</hi> J. with a ſmile. Many Inferences might be made from this paſſage, which we for <hi>Brevities ſake</hi> omit. Yet we cannot get by this one; viz. that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and ſome other brethren were fully reſolv'd to paſs on unfavourable Sentence, and that many days before they met in Synod. If this be not a <hi>Fore-ſtalling of the Mercat,</hi> let the world judge.</p>

                     <hi>DUns,</hi> 28 <hi>july,</hi> 96. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> knew very well, if the Provincial Synod of <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Tiviotdale,</hi> with the Correſpondents from other places ſhould paſs a Sentence againſt him, it wou'd exceedingly <hi>puzzle</hi> the G. A. how to carry on the Affair. On the one ſide, it wou'd be a moſt unpleaſant <hi>Task</hi> to condemn the Sentence of ſuch a Synod. On th'other, it could not but be troubleſome to juſtify the many illegal and unjuſt acts, which that judicature and its Committees were guilty of. And therefore he was concern'd to uſe all Lawful means, and to ſpare no pains, nor Expences to prevent, if he could, a Sentence. He was not a little ſtraitned as to time; for he only took his reſolution 2 or 3 days before the Synod ſat down. In he poſts to <hi>Ear:</hi> from thence to <hi>Broxmouth:</hi> from that to <hi>Kelſo:</hi> in again to <hi>Edr:</hi> back to <hi>Kelſo:</hi> next day to <hi>Duns;</hi> and back that ſame day to <hi>Kelſo.</hi> In all about 142 well met <hi>Scots</hi> miles; but certainly above 200 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or rather 300 <hi>Italian.</hi> In this little journey he traveld day and night. Going from <hi>Kelſo</hi> about 8 a clock in the evening, he fell out of the road in a moor ſome place forgainſt <hi>Lauder,</hi> where he was forc'd to ſit and walk up and down with his horſe in his hand, from eleven a clock till day light, in a very dark and rainy night. But that, which far rather deſerves to be here recorded, is the exceding great <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> or rather <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> in ſome Perſon of great Honour; and the exceſſive <hi>Rudneſs</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> in others of a far lower degree. Know then that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> got from that noble Lady, C. of <hi>R.</hi> (tho at that very time exceſſively afflicted with the news of her ſon the Earls dangerous ſickneſs in <hi>Flanders</hi>) to My <hi>Lord Polwart</hi> (now Earl of <hi>March-mount</hi>) Lord high Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Letter, craving his Lo. wou'd be pleaſ'd to write to the M at <hi>Duns</hi> in Mr K's. favours. When Mr. K. came to My <hi>Lord Chancellor's</hi> Lodgings, tho his Lo. was at that time very buſy writing letters, it being a Poſt-night; yet one of his ſervants telling that Mr. K. in Kelſo, was waiting for a word of his Lo. Such was M. Lord Chancellors <hi>Diſcretion, Humility, Condeſcenſion,</hi> or what elſe you pleaſe to call it in a Vertnes ſenſe, that immediately he was pleas'd to come to the room, where Mr K. was, and carried in ſuch a diſcreet and affable manner toward him, that no ſtranger could have gueſs'd their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. In ſhort: his Lo. promis'd as ſoon as he had diſpatch'd ſome letters for <hi>London-Poſt,</hi> he ſhould write an Anſwer to the C. of <hi>R</hi>'s. letter: which accordingly was done. As to the Contents of this letter, it was as favourable for Mr. K. as any perſon of <hi>Integrity,</hi> or one in My <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi> Circumſtances could write. Mr. K. no ſooner recives the Letter, but home he flees to <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Duns;</hi> where he waited at the Church door all forenoon) there being no Sermon; becauſe the Miniſter, who ſhould have preach'd, was indiſpos'd) ſometimes requeſting this Brother, ſometimes that (above 30 in all) to get him acceſs, but to no purpoſe, not imagining all this while, that they knew any thing of the letter from the <hi>Chancellor.</hi>

was the Cauſe he was not ſuffer'd to enter. This Gentleman durſt not take</hi> Mr. K. <hi>in with him. By good providence Mr.</hi> S. <hi>coming out of the Church,</hi> Mr. K. <hi>crav'd to ſpeak with him a part: whereupon they ſtepp'd a little aſide. Sir, ſaid</hi> Mr. K. <hi>I have been all this day waiting here, earneſtly begging liberty to go into your Church to ſpeak, but one word to the M. I humbly intreat you, take me in with you.

We are to riſe this night,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Mr.</hi> S. <hi>and ſit again within a moneth at</hi> Kelſo: <hi>you may keep that letter, till we meet there. We know 'tis about your buſineſs; and ſince we are to do nothing in it here, tis altogether needleſs to deliver the letter, Excuſe me, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>It wou'd be a moſt impertinent; yea a diſtracted act in me to receive a letter from the Chancellor of</hi> Scotland. <hi>to the Moderator at</hi> Duns, <hi>and to keep it up, till you meet at</hi> Kelſo, <hi>eſpecially conſidering that I am ſtanding here at your Church door with the letter in my hand. And beſides, Sir,</hi> continu'd <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>I muſt tell you, that I do not certainly know what is in the letter: and ſuppoſe it ſpeak of my Affair; yet there may be ſome thing elſe in it. Notwithſtanding all Mr.</hi> K. <hi>could ſay to this purpoſe, he did not prevail. At laſt, as Mr.</hi> S. <hi>was going away;</hi> Sir, <hi>ſaid Mr.</hi> K. <hi>I muſt be yet plainer with you. If you will not ſuffer me to enter the Church, I' will go for a publick Notar, and proteſt againſt your carriage towards me, here at your Kirk-door. Mr,</hi> S. <hi>ſlipp'd away without giving any Anſwer, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately therefore, Mr.</hi> K. <hi>runs with all ſpeed to his old acquaintance, Mr</hi> Winram <hi>Sheriff-clerk, and gave him a ſhort accunt of the buſineſs. You muſt either, anſwer'd he, deliver the letter, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aginst them at the Chuch door; and immediately he ſent for a Notar. Mr.</hi> K. <hi>fearing the Synod might riſe before the Notar came, haſted back to the Church, and ruſh'd in with another man, the Officer (for he oppos'd what he could) complain'd to the</hi> M. <hi>that he broke in againſt his will. To ſpeak the truth, the Brethrens carriage towards Mr.</hi> K. <hi>put him into ſuch a</hi> Mood, <hi>that he hardly knew well what he was doing. Much pains and travel he had been at to get this letter; and it very near cost him his life in the moor abovemention'd, where he lodg'd all night; and now, when he had brought it to the Church door, if he ſhould not deliver it out of his hand, all the world might juſtly laugh at him. Now know, that Mr.</hi> J. <hi>was</hi> M. <hi>but it fell ſo well out at this moment, when Mr.</hi> K. <hi>entred the Church, that</hi> Dr. Hardy, <hi>was occaſionally moderating, and juſt cloſing the buſineſs then in hand, And therefore Mr.</hi> K. <hi>ſtepping forward to the table, without any further Complement, ſaid,</hi> M. <hi>I have here a letter directed to you from My Lord Polwart, Lord high Chancellor of</hi> Scotland. <hi>Lo, there 'tis.

That was a Deviliſh ſuſpicion in them poſitively to aver, that he and his Party had a <hi>Satanical</hi> deſign by asking the <hi>Question</hi> there mentioned, <hi>Satan's</hi> deſign certainly is to ruine both Soul and Body. All Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſays in this particular of the ſtrange carriage of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters towards him at <hi>Duns,</hi> is, that 'tis a <hi>Mystery</hi> to him.

                     <hi>KElſo,</hi> 20, 21 and 22 days of <hi>Oct.</hi> 1696. Theſe are three very diſmal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky days; but whether more to Mr. K. than to the other <hi>Party,</hi> time will determine. This Meeting of the Synod, and that of the Preſbytery with one ſingle Aſſiſtant (24 <hi>Sept.</hi> 95. of which <hi>Sect</hi> 8. &amp;c. <hi>Part</hi> 3.) are the two grand Judicatures; wherein anything of moment was acted: the one laid the Foundation; the other Built the Superſtructure of a moſt unjuſt Sentence. How ſandy a Foundation that is, we ſhew'd in its place; and hence it cannot but follow, that what is built thereon, muſt be very unſound work. For the better clearing of this ſo material a Point, we ſhall firſt ſpeak a little of ſome of the Members of this Synod, and next of their Actions. <hi>Of the Members,</hi> Before we Fall on this Point, Mr. K. humbly begs liberty to uſe all Lawful means to vindicate his own and Poſterities good name. 'Tis an ancient ſaying, <hi>Proximus ſum egomet mihi; Charity begins at home.</hi> When his, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Reputation fall in competition, ſo that the one muſt Periſh: no man in reaſon can blame him to defend his own, tho' to the ruine of his Neighbours. 1. As to the Synod in general, they pretend, that they may proceed even to a Sentence, notwithſtanding one of the Parties appeal from them. We ſhall not here enquire what in Equity and Juſtice may be done in this matter; and whether or not, it holds in all caſes, only we ſay, that the Appellant in that caſe is not obliged to regard the Sentence of the Judge. 2. As to the many Honourable and Worthy Gentlemen, the Ruling Elders, Mr. K. here declares them altogether innocent, and free in an <hi>Active Senſe</hi> of having any hand in the following Sentence paſſed againſt him; and earneſtly prays God may forgive them for being guilty in a <hi>Paſſive Senſe;</hi> for there was not ſo much as one of them preſent at this Synod; and yet ſome of them, even in this ſenſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable; for they knew not there was to be a Synod, till after it was met, otherwiſe, ſaid they, we had not fail'd to come. And ſince the Synod meets not on a fix'd day, Gentlemen ought to be Advertiſed. 3. Tho' Mr. K. has very relevant Objections (as he Conceives) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſeveral of the Miniſters, that ſat his Judges, in this Synod; yet for <hi>Brevities</hi> ſake, he thinks fit here to paſs them all except two, whom he cannot get by in ſilence, the one being the <hi>Head,</hi> and chief perſon amongſt them; he that ſat at Helm, and Ruled all things: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Foot,</hi> the meaneſt indeed in Office; yet ſuch an one, who, tho' not a Judge, has a great ſtroke, and Powers in matters of this kind. And you know if there be a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or Megrim in the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Gout</hi> in the <hi>Foot,</hi> 'tis not poſſible, that perſon can walk ſtrait. This Simile is ſo pat and plain in it ſelf, that it needs no Explication. The Perſons are Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Moderator, and Mr. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Clerk.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>EXceptions against</hi> Mr. Gaudy. Mr. K. humbly offers to your ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe following Reaſons, why Mr. <hi>Gaudy</hi> ought not to Officiate as Clerk in this Debate. You muſt in the firſt place lay down as a Certain Poſition (which no man in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or of experience in ſuch matters, will deny) <hi>viz. That a Clerk</hi> (eſpecially one of the ſame <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> with the Judges, and much more, if a Judge alſo) <hi>is in a Capacity to do much good to the Party he favours; and no little hurt to that he has no kindneſs to. And the more tedious and intricate the</hi> Plea <hi>is the greater good, or evil he can do them.</hi> 1. Much depends upon the way and manner of wording and expreſſing things; and often this is in the Clerks power. 2. The Clerk on the account of a Dear Friend, or for ſome other <hi>Byaſs,</hi> dare ſometimes venture to add, empair, or change a word; which very often is a matter of no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle importance. 3. He can let the party he Favours have the uſe of Papers, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 4. When the Parties are removed, and only the Clerk left with the Judges, he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal what is done in ſecret, and inform the Party he favours, how this and the other <hi>Scruple</hi> may be removed, which is a ſingular Advantage. Now you are to know, that we found not our Aſſertion upon Topicks, or probable Arguments. No, No. We walk on far more ſure ground, than only to alledge that Mr. <hi>Gaudy</hi> might, or could do the other Party this or that act of kindneſs We poſitively aver, that he has really done them very many ſingular favours, and has refuſed to do the like to Mr. K. Yea, has flatly deny'd him ſuch acts of Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as a Clerk is obliged to by Office. This you have again and again above told you, So that he has been exceeding Partial in this affair. Yea, we dare ſay more, than ſo; <hi>viz. That it is ſimply impoſſible he could ſhun to be ſuch;</hi> becauſe he is one of the Party, and that a very conſiderable one; one that is very much concern'd in this Plea, both as to Credit and Intereſt. We need not here again repeat, how he, and the reſt of the Members of the Preſbytery have ſpent and conſumed Mr. K's <hi>Revenues; viz.</hi> The Profits under debate, and paſſed an Act, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36252:67"/>
the ſame for another uſe, than for his behalf. So that in a word, if you had run thro' the World to find out an unfit perſon for this Office, you could not have fall'n upon a fitter for your purpoſe; and one more for Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s hurt, than Mr. <hi>G.</hi> or any other of the Members of <hi>Kelſo</hi>-Preſbytery. For, 1. by this means you have put the whole Proceſs into the Cuſtody of one of the Parties; ſo that they may view, and re-view Papers at pleaſure. Yea, they may throw ſome of them by, or caſt them into the Fire, and by their Oath (as has been done) depone ſuch and ſuch things were in them (<hi>Sect.</hi> 21. Part. 3.) And yet Mr. <hi>K.</hi> cannot have ſo much as a look of ſuch Papers, as the Supreme Law of the Kingdom not only allows, but enjoyns ſhould be given him. 2. By this means the one Party continues ſtill with the Judges, when the other is removed; for certainly a perſon of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Qualifications and Circumſtances, may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, as equivalent to all: he can inform the reſt better than any of the Judges. This, if conſidered, will be found to be a very great act of Injuſtice done to Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and a <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Partiality in the Judges; eſpecially ſince they were told that he was a Party. 3. If it may be ſuppoſed (which few will deny but they know it by experience, if ever they had to do with ſuch People) that a Clerk may Record amiſs, by adding, empairing, or changing, a word for his Dear Friend; may we not much more ſuppoſe, that he will do it for himſelf? We need not ſuppoſe this, ſeeing we can infallibly prove that 'tis done oftner than once. To conclude this Point. It may truly ſeem a <hi>Wonder</hi> of <hi>Wonders</hi> to ſee one and the ſame perſon ſit as <hi>Judge,</hi> adduc'd as a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> officiate as <hi>Clerk,</hi> and (which is worſt of all) be one of the <hi>Party.</hi> Now of theſe 4 Offices, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> perform'd 3 in one Minute; he was a <hi>Party,</hi> a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and a <hi>Judge;</hi> yea, the <hi>Moderator</hi> of that Famous Judicature, which ſat 24 <hi>Sept.</hi> 95. And yet Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> in <hi>Ednim</hi> did exceed Mr. <hi>G.</hi> that day; for he was a <hi>Party,</hi> a <hi>Judge,</hi> a <hi>Clerk,</hi> and a <hi>Witneſs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Glen</hi> in <hi>Stitchel</hi> was little ſhort of either; for he was the whole Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> ſupplying the place of many Judges, and repreſenting as many <hi>Parties.</hi> Above all the reſt, we muſt confeſs, that Mr. <hi>Couden</hi> in <hi>Duns</hi> acted his Part ſo to the Life, that none in this World ſhall ever be able to go beyond him; for he alone that day (as above-related) repreſenting all the 12 Aſſiſtants, not only made moſt diligent ſearch thro' all the Corners of this <hi>Earth;</hi> but (as you heard) went down to the Regions below to ſee what could be had there, that might make any ways againſt Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Nor was Mr. <hi>J.</hi> you may be ſure, wanting in his part, the fitteſt man on Earth to bring up the <hi>Rear,</hi> and to puſh forward to Battle. He had alſo ſeveral Poſts or Offices; for he was a <hi>Judge,</hi> a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Head of the Party:</hi> or in a more proper ſenſe, he might be called <hi>General Adjutant,</hi> or <hi>Muſter-maſter,</hi> for well can he excite them to their duties, and chaſtize ſuch as tranſgreſs, at leaſt with moſt bitter and contumelious words. We read in ſome of the Antient Writers, many ſtrange ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Amongſt other things, they tell us of many <hi>Monstrous Creatures: Chimera,</hi> they ſay, had the Head and Breſt of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> the Belly of a <hi>Goat,</hi> and Feet like ſerpents. Some Giants had 50 Heads, and 100 Hands. They talk of ſome ſo mighty great, that with their Body and Arms they could cover Acres of Land. What truth here is in theſe things, we ſhall not debate; nor what gave riſe to ſuch ſtories and fables. All we ſhall ſay at preſent, is, that the abovementioned Judicature ſeems no leſs <hi>Monſtrous,</hi> than any of them; and as we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe ſtories to be real truths, neither will our Poſterity believe there was ſuch a Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World as ſat the 24 <hi>Sept.</hi> 95. at <hi>Kelſo.</hi>

                     <hi>EXceptions againſt</hi> Mr. Semple. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is a great Man in the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Leading Member in every Judicature, named always with the Firſt. Hence ſome call him <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Mers <hi>and</hi> Tiviotdale. So that you will ſay, it ſeems dangerous to write any thing about a perſon of ſo high Eſteem. Mr. K. is not ignorant of this, but he finds and abſolute neceſſity either to write (be the hazard what it will) otherwiſe to leave a Stain, both on his own, and Poſterities Good-Name, which is dealer to him than his very Life; for he hopes, that ſhall live, when he ſhall lie down in the duſt. And he reſolves to write nothing but truth; things he himſelf is Ear and Eye-witneſs to, or what he has received by good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. In ſhort, know, that Mr, <hi>S.</hi> ought not to ſit Judge, far leſs Mod. in that Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein this <hi>Plea</hi> is to be determined; Becauſe he is a Party; and that if all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were well Conſidered, the chief and prime in the opoſite ſide, there being none more byaſsd in point of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> than he; and equal to any as to Intereſt, ſo that in effect he is a Corrupt Judge. Miſtake us not, we mean not a Judge corrupted by Gifts, or Briber; but one exceedingly Prepoſſeſſed with ſuch a <hi>Byaſs,</hi> that there is little or no ground
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36252:68"/>
to think he will act Impartially in this Affair. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> we ſay, is a Party by being a Member of the Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo;</hi> for you muſt know, when Mr <hi>K.</hi> came to that place (16 <hi>May</hi> 1692. the Preſbytery of <hi>Jedburgh</hi> and <hi>Kelſo</hi> were one and the ſame; a Joynt Preſbytery, ſitting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> generally by turns, and continued ſo a long time thereafter. Hence, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> we ſay, eſpecially being a leading Member, oppoſed Mr. K. in his juſt right from his very Entry; particularly, <hi>Jan.</hi> 93. of which Buſineſs you have a large Account, <hi>ſect.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c. part</hi> 1: Yea, he with the reſt of the members of that joint-Presbytery. did paſs an Act, as is once and again above related, appointing the Profits and Emoluments under debate for another Uſe than Mr. K's Behalf; of which <hi>ſect.</hi> 1.3. <hi>parag.</hi> 12. Now, is not Mr. <hi>S.</hi> think you, very much concerned to defend his Honour and Credit in all this Affair? Do you expect he now will act contrary to what then he did? This were to cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and to crave Mr. <hi>K</hi>'s pardon for the Injury he has done him; and to declare to the World, <hi>That it was an unjust Act, whereby they deprived Mr.</hi> K. <hi>of the Profits, and dispos'd of them for their own Ends.</hi> This is ſuch a mighty ſtrong <hi>Byaſs,</hi> that it cannot but make him a partial Judge in this Plea: a Party indeed he is, and that one of the firſt Degree? <hi>And ſhall a man ſit Judge in his own Cauſe?</hi> A ſecond unanſwerable Argument, why Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ought not to ſit Judge, far leſs Moderator in this Plea, is, <hi>Becauſe he was prepoſseſsed with Prejudice.</hi> With <hi>Prejudice,</hi> we ſay, <hi>in its moſt native and proper Signification:</hi> for he had <hi>prejudged</hi> the Cauſe, and paſſed Sentence aforehand. He and others were firmly reſolved what to do in the Affair, before they were met in Synod: ſo that their meeting there, was only for the faſhion. This is a moſt dreadful Buſineſs; 'Tis the very height of Iniquity to condemn a man unheard. By this means, tho' Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had ſpoken like an Angel in his own Defence, it had been to no purpoſe; for nothing he could ſay, would have avail'd in a Cauſe concluded many days before they met, as moſt evidently appears from that Communing between Sir <hi>J. P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S. (ſect.</hi> 18.) <hi>You may aſsure Mr.</hi> K. (ſaid Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to Sir <hi>J.) that a very unfavourable Sentence will paſs againſt him, if he do not either dimitt, or give in a Paper to the Synod, obliging himſelf to ſtand to what they ſhall determine in the matter.</hi> We walk not here, you ſee, upon Conjectures or Preſumptions, as ſome do, alledging, <hi>Mr.</hi> S. <hi>ran always croſs to Mr.</hi> K. <hi>on the Account of that Letter mentioned,</hi> ſect. 8.

Theſe things might indeed add, and that conſiderably, to the Byaſs: but we build our Aſſertion upon moſt <hi>legal and juſt Grounds,</hi> ſuch as no Perſon will deny, <hi>viz No man ought to be Judge in his own Cauſe.</hi> This the Synod at <hi>Jedburgh</hi> found to be moſt rational and juſt: and therefore they laid aſide the whole Preſbytery of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> from judging in this Affair, little then conſidering, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> was one of the chief of them. And as to the other Reaſon, <hi>viz. That no man ought to be condemned till he be heard:</hi> or, <hi>no Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ought to be extrajudicia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Will any man, think you, ſay ought againſt this? There remains yet another thing, which we cannot well paſs in Silence, it making exceeding much to our preſent Purpoſe, being a further <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of Mr. <hi>Semple</hi>'s Unfitneſs to be a Judge, far leſs a Moderator, in this Plea. In ſhort, 'tis this: So great is the Influence, which he has upon the Generality of his Brethren, and the Stroke and Sway he bears in their Judicatures, that he can almoſt turn them, when and whither he pleaſes. The younger Sort, or <hi>new Entrants,</hi> no ſooner Begin to peep, (if they run not his way) but immediately he takes them by the Noſe, and ſets them into his own Road. Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> in <hi>Ednim,</hi> ſome little time after he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, at a Synod in <hi>Kelſo,</hi> beginning to ſpeak as he could; <hi>What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Know then, that the whole Pariſh, (Heretors, Elders and others, not ſo much as one ſingle Perſon appearing to the contrary) was for one Mr. <hi>Angely,</hi> a Perſon, they ſay, ſufficiently qualified for the Office. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> oppoſed him with Tooth and Nail, while the Matter was depending before the Preſbytery. After no i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

as they are call'd, of <hi>Mers</hi> and <hi>Tiviotdale</hi>) wrought ſo powerfully, that they got Mr. <hi>Angely</hi> kept out of <hi>Linton.</hi> But the thing here moſt worthy our Notice is, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> came to this Synod, according, it ſeems, to his uſe and wont, ſtuff'd with <hi>Prejudice: Prejudice,</hi> we mean, in the above mention'd Senſe for he ſaid to a Perſon of honour, and others the day before the Synod met, that Mr <hi>Angely</hi> ſhould not come to <hi>Linton.</hi> Now, to conclude, tho you had made Enquiry through the world for an unfit Perſon to be Mod. in this Plea, you could not have fall'n upon one fitter for your purpoſe, than Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whether you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his <hi>Byaſs</hi> his <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or his <hi>Power.</hi> Any of theſe three, ſingly taken, is of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but jointly conſidered, they are <hi>intolerable.

                  </p>
                  <p>Pray, do not miſtake us in this matter, as if we thought every man, that has Influence on others, unfit to be a <hi>Judge, Preſes,</hi> or <hi>Mod.</hi> among them. Yea, on the contrary, we cannot, but acknowledge, that he is rather more fit for ſuch an Office, eſpecially if that <hi>Qualification</hi> proceed from his Merits and Vertues; ſuch as his <hi>Piety, Knowledge, Learning,</hi> &amp;c. All we here aver, is, that this <hi>Qualification</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> in Mr. <hi>S.</hi> being join'd with the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Byaſs,</hi> and <hi>Prejudice,</hi> renders him the moſt unfit Perſon in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (except perhaps Mr. <hi>J.</hi>) to be a Judge, farleſs Mod. in that judicature, which is to determine in this Affair.</p>

He was cited by their Officer 3 days before they met, and that after the ſame manner, it was always formerly done 2. The Synod having met and ſit the whole day without calling him, at night they conſidering more narrowly his Summons with the Execution, find them Informal and therefore order him to be cited <hi>De Nero,</hi> to appear the next day, which was done about 7 a clock at night. This is a <hi>Demonstration</hi> that even according to the judgment of the Synod, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> never got a Legal Citation before this laſt; for all were conform one to another. 3. A Committee meeting in the Moderator's Chamber in Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s houſe, (the fitteſt place in the world for their deſign) and further conſidering the ſaid ſecond Citation, found it alſo faulty, and therefore order their Officer to ſummon him the third time, about ten at night. There is a very conſiderable alteration in the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for by adding a word they exceedingly empair the matter. In the firſt two they deſign Mr. <hi>K Schoolmaſter of Kelſo;</hi> in the laſt <hi>Pretended Schoolmaſter</hi> only, This Committee meeting in Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s. houſe, become quicker ſighted, than the Synod ſitting in the houſe of God. They receiv'd, it ſeems a new light, by getting from him a <hi>Sip of Pegaſus's Well.</hi> Yet they recanted before the next morning; for when they were come again to the houſe of God, they in another paper later, than any of the three Summons, call him <hi>Preſent School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter;</hi> which when he heard read, he could not contain himſelf from ſaying with a ſmile; <hi>M. you aſtoniſh me with your Papers, ſometimes calling me one thing, ſometimes another. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night at ſeven a clock you deſign'd me Schoolmaſter of Kelſo; about ten Pretended Schoolmaſter; and now Preſent Schoolmaſter: you twirle me round, as if I were a Whirligig.</hi> If any doubt of the truth of theſe things, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> can produce the 4 ſaid <hi>Authentick</hi> Papers, demonſtrating what's above related. We ſhould by right order have begun this Section by telling you, that when Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was call'd in before this Synod, in the firſt place he proteſted, that his Apperance there might not be prejudicial to his Appeal, next being told by Mr. S. Moderator, that they had call'd him in to hear a Paper read in his Preſence. <hi>I deſire to know M.</hi> anſwer'd Mr. <hi>K. whether that paper relates to the Proceſs which now by an Appeal is carried from this judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature to the next enſuing G. A. or be ſome new buſineſs? If it relate to the former Proceſs;</hi> I <hi>humbly beg your Pardon, if I refuſe to hear it. If it be a new Charge, I ought to have been cited for that end. We are not oblig'd,</hi> reply'd the M. <hi>to tell you, whether it be a new buſineſs, or an old. Nor do</hi> I <hi>think my ſelf bound, M.</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>to hear I know not what: eſpecially ſince I look not on you, as my judges.</hi> And with this he left them, taking Inſtruments on what paſs'd on both ſides.</p>

If I had not ſomething elſe to do before you,</hi> reply'd <hi>Mr.</hi> K. <hi>I wou'd not come in at your Call; for ye are not now my judges.</hi> In he goes, and in the firſt place proteſts that his Appearance before them was not in obedience to their Call? and therefore ought not to militate againſt his Appeal, a he crav'd an <hi>Extract</hi> of the whole Proceſs, particularly of the Depoſitions of witneſſes; but more eſpecially, and above all an <hi>Extract,</hi> or <hi>Double</hi> of theſe two <hi>Helliſh</hi> Papers he heard were read before them. When he call'd them <hi>Helliſh;</hi> J. <hi>T.</hi> one of the Libellers or Elders proteſted againſt the ſaid Word: whereupon Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſaid to the Clerk and him; <hi>See, ye forget not to put into your Inſtruments, that I call theſe your Papers, not only Helliſh, but Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh alſo; and worſe, if I had a worſe word; for they Call me The Devils Agent,</hi> &amp;c. The Synod flatly refuſing to give any <hi>Extracts,</hi> particularly of the two ſaid reviling Papers, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did further proteſt, that they might be kept <hi>In Retentis,</hi> without having any thing added to, empair'd from or chang'd in them, telling the Synod, eſpecially their Clerk, that perhaps it might come to paſs, that ſome of them wou'd be oblig'd to depone that theſe are the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,</hi> Individual Copies, which were read in face of this Synod.

After the Sentence is read, Mr. K. is remov'd; and being call'd in again, he proteſted as before. Then ſaid the <hi>M.</hi> I wou'd, aſk you one thing; but 'tis a matter of very ſmall moment. If you will paſs from your Appeal; we will give you the <hi>Extracts.</hi> Is this the matter of ſmall moment; M. reply'd Mr. K. No, No. Upon no other terms will I paſs from my Appeal; unleſs you paſs from your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and give me the Extracts of the Proceſs, that ſo we may go on Equally, and legally. What advantage can I have by the <hi>Extracts,</hi> after the Cauſe is concluded. They will be of no more uſe to me, than <hi>Phyſick</hi> to a dead man.

Sir, if you were not in the Station you are, and in the Place where you ſit, I know what Anſwer I would give you for theſe moſt falſe and contumelious Words you have uttered, but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak more to you.</hi> And with this, turning his face towards the Elders, he ſaid, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I think I need not fear to ſpeak to you: pray, tell me, was Sir J. H. in his Cloſet, when I ſtruggl'd with the Laſs in</hi> Blakader? To which none of them opened their Mouth. By this, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> ſignified, that it was beyond all doubt, that theſe Elders were guilty of a moſt dreadful Lye: and by an infallible Conſequence Mr. <hi>J.</hi> himſelf was not altogether free. By the way, know that 'tis not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> alone, whom Mr. <hi>J.</hi> uſes thus to reproach and revile from the Pulpit, and while he ſits in Judgment with his Elders.

                  <p>ON the laſt day of the year 96.

The Nature and Sum of which Complaint, you may eaſily collect from the preceding Parts of this Plea. The Reaſons of Appeal you have <hi>Sect.</hi> 16, <hi>Part</hi> 4. After the ſaid Complaint, and Reaſons of Appeal were read, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately was produc'd a Paper call'd, <hi>Anſwers to the ſaid Reaſons,</hi> compos'd, they ſay, by Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Which alſo being read, the M. aſk'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> what he had to ſay againſt the ſaid Paper. I did never ſee this Paper in my life, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>K.</hi> Yea, nor did I hear of any ſuch thing before this moment: and therefore, M. I humbly crave, I may have it up, and time to See and anſwer. This being deny'd, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> further urg'd, ſaying; M. They have had my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per among their hands theſe 9 or 10 months; I crave theirs, but one ſingle night; and I promiſe (God willng) to anſwer it againſt to morrow at what time you pleaſe, M. conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd he, it will be thought very ſtrange, if you deny me this requeſt. When he ſaw, that nothing could prevail; but that he behov'd to anſwer <hi>Ex tempore.</hi> (or off hand;) without ſo much as being permitted to look on the Paper, he told them In general, that it was a moſt <hi>abſurd falſe</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> Paper: that there were not many true Sentences in it; which he offered to make good, if legal means were allow'd him. And, as it was, he ſaid, he needed not travel into it to find out groſs falſhoods; for the very firſt 3 or 4 lines did furniſh him ſufficiently with <hi>Them things;</hi> of which he gave them an <hi>Inſtance</hi> or two. It were endleſs to run through Particulars: nor can Mr. <hi>K.</hi> promiſe faithfully to do it, unleſs he were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the uſe of the ſaid Paper with ſeveral others, which are moſt unjuſtly kept from him.

therefore, that immediately after this ſhort but pretty brisk Skirmiſh, about the ſaid <hi>John Turnbul,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirtin,</hi> one of the Miniſters of <hi>Edr,</hi> laid his Leg over the ſeat and left them; tho' Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (we muſt confeſs) ſomewhat unmannerly not only preſs'd him to ſtay, but even too rudely took hold on his Cloak, yet could not prevail.

Part 3. A very little while after Mr. <hi>Kirtin</hi> was gone, the Committee came to Sentence, which in ſhort was, <hi>That Mr.</hi> K. <hi>Appeal'd without having juſt ground</hi> So that his Appeal fell, or became void and null. He ask'd the <hi>M. what they did as to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Synod? We will not meddle with that,</hi> anſwer'd he. After this he made a ſhort diſcourſe, whereby he rebuked Mr. K. pretty tartly for his Reflections (as he call'd them) in his papers againſt the Judicatures of the Church, and told him, tho' they would not cenſure him for the ſame, yet it was like, others would do it; meaning, no queſtion, the <hi>Lords of Privy Council:</hi> Whom elſe, pray, could he think on? Mr. K. having patiently heard all that the <hi>M.</hi> had to ſay, gave this Anſwer: M. <hi>whether theſe words and expreſſions in my Papers, which you are pleaſed to call Reflections againſt the Judicatures of the Church, or their Acts, and Carriage towards me, which I alledge to be moſt unjuſt and illegal, be more cenſurable, we muſt now leave to the World to judge.</hi> And thus they parted.</p>
                  <p>By the way here know, that this day while Mr. K. was walking to and fro in the high Church, one of the Miniſters of <hi>Edr</hi> coming out from the Commiſſion, ſays to him: Mr. K. Mr. K. (wagging his finger, and ſhaking his head) <hi>You was a malicious act in you to contradict Mr.</hi> J. <hi>in the Pulpit. Malicious!

In the very Frontiſpiece of the printed Libel you have a Legion of <hi>Falſhoods</hi> and <hi>Lies,</hi> all knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a bundle in theſe and ſome other following words, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. W.
